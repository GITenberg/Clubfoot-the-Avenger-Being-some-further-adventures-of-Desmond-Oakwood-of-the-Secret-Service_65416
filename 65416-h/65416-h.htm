<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>At the risk of straining an old and valued
friendship, I have persuaded Major Desmond
Okewood and his brother to allow me
to set down in narrative form some account
of a remarkable series of events that, for
reasons sufficiently obvious, have never been
fully described.</p>
<p>It is now some eighteen months since Dr.
Adolf Grundt, the notorious German Secret
Service agent, better known to the British
Intelligence Corps as &ldquo;The Man with the
Club Foot,&rdquo; was last heard of; and there appears
to remain no valid grounds why the
extraordinary happenings which marked his
reappearance in England should not now
be related, especially as they were sedulously
withheld from the newspapers at the
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_x">x</div>
<p>Though Major Desmond Okewood and
his brother, Mr. Francis Okewood, played a
prominent part in these strange adventures,
I have been unable to persuade either of
them to tell the story himself. It has therefore
fallen to my lot to be the Froissart of
this chronicle. I do not fear criticism; for
my severest critics have been the brothers
themselves. Desmond Okewood, for instance,
jibs strongly at what he calls my
&ldquo;incurable love of the dramatic&rdquo;; while
Francis, after reading through my much-censored
and revised manuscript, pitched it
back at me with the curt remark that the interesting
thing about Secret Service yarns
is what you are obliged to leave out.</p>
<p>On this plea, then, that in Secret Service
matters the whole truth can seldom be told,
I would claim indulgence; and, further, on
the score that this narrative has been pieced
together from talks, often spasmodic and disjointed,
with my two friends in all manner
of odd places&mdash;the golf links, the tennis
court, in the train, the Berkeley grill, the
smoke-room of the Senior. Sometimes I
questioned; but more often I was a listener
when a chance remark, a name read in a
newspaper, a face seen in a crowd, started
the flow of reminiscence. And so, little by
little, I gathered the facts about the re&euml;mergence
out of the fire and smoke of the World
War of this extraordinary character, who, in
his day, wielded only less power in Imperial
Germany than the Emperor himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</div>
<p>In a short span of years immense changes
have taken place in Europe. To-day it is a far
cry to the times of Dr. Grundt and the &ldquo;G&rdquo;
Branch of Section Seven of the Prussian
Political Police. As head of the ex-Kaiser&rsquo;s
personal Secret Service, &ldquo;der Stelze,&rdquo; as
the Germans nicknamed him from his crippled
foot, was the all-powerful instrument of
the anger and suspicion of the capricious and
neurotic William II. In Germany his very
existence was a mere rumour whispered only
in the highest circles; and abroad, except in
the innermost ring of the Secret Service, he
was quite unknown. In the archives of the
French Foreign Office there is, I understand,
a dossier dealing with his activities of the
time of the Algeciras Conference and, later,
on the occasion of King Edward&rsquo;s meeting
with the Czar at Reval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</div>
<p>My friends, the two Okewoods, are reticent
on this point; but I make no doubt that
they, who originally encompassed the downfall
of &ldquo;der Stelze,&rdquo; know more about the
secret history of his career than any other
man living, except the ex-Emperor himself.
Perhaps, now that memoirs are the fashion,
from the seclusion of the little property he is
known to possess in southern Germany, The
Man with the Clubfoot may one day give
the world some pages from his career. If
he tell the truth&mdash;and Desmond Okewood
says he is the kind of man who glories in
the blackest crimes&mdash;his revelations should
eclipse the memoirs of S&eacute;nart or Vidocq.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</div>
<p>I have begun, as a story-teller should, at
the beginning and set down the extraordinary
circumstances of the first case to engage
the attention of my two friends on the
reappearance of Dr. Grundt in England.
The affair of the purple cabriolet, which the
newspapers at the time reported as a case of
suicide, was actually the fourth link in the
horrifying chain of crimes which marked
Dr. Grundt&rsquo;s campaign of vengeance against
the British Secret Service. I have made it
my point of departure, however, because it
was not until after the mysterious deaths of
Sir Wetherby Soukes, Colonel Branxe, and
Mr. Fawcett Wilbur that Desmond and
Francis Okewood, who had already retired
from the Secret Service, were called back to
the sphere of their former activity.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PURPLE CABRIOLET</span></h2>
<p>It was a wet night. The rain fell in
torrents. The low archway leading
into Pump Yard, Saint James&rsquo;s, framed a
nocturne of London beneath weeping skies.
The street beyond was a shining sheet of wet,
the lamps making blurred streaks of yellow
on the gleaming surface of the asphalt.
Within, on the rough cobbles of the yard, the
rain splashed and spurted like a thousand
dancing knives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>On either side of the small square cars
were drawn up in two long lines, the overflow
from the lock-ups of the garage set all round
the yard. At the open door of a plum-coloured
cabriolet, his oilskins shining black in
the pale rays of a gas-lamp above his head, a
policeman stood, peering over the shoulder of
a man in a raincoat who was busying himself
over something inside the car. Behind him
a glistening umbrella almost completely
obscured the form of another man who was
talking in whispers to a gnome-like figure in
overalls, a sack flung over his head and
shoulders in protection against the persistent
rain.</p>
<p>Presently from the direction of the street
came the grating of changing gears, the
throb of an engine. Blazing head-lights
clove the hazy chiaroscuro of the yard and a
car, high-splashed with mud, drove slowly
in. It stopped, the hand-brake jarred, and,
with a jerk, the headlights were extinguished.
A young man in a heavy overcoat laboriously
disentangled himself from behind the driving-wheel
and stepped out from under the
sopping hood, stretching his legs and stamping
his feet as though stiff with cold.</p>
<p>On catching sight of him, the man with
the umbrella fussed up. He disclosed a face
that was grey with apprehension.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever do you think has happened,
Major Okewood?&rdquo; he said in a hoarse whisper.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dead man in the Lancia
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jerked his head backwards in the direction
of the cabriolet.</p>
<p>The newcomer, who was vigorously rubbing
his numbed hands together, glanced up
quickly. He had a lean, clever face with
very keen blue eyes and a small dark moustache.
Of medium height, he looked as fit
as nails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Fink?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;A fit
or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fink, who was foreman of the garage,
shook his head impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a suicide. Leastwise, that&rsquo;s what the
doctor says. Poisoned hisself. There&rsquo;s a
bottle on the mat inside the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, interested.
&ldquo;Who is it? One of your customers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never set eyes on him before nor yet the
car. He&rsquo;s a poorly dressed sort of chap. I
think he jest crawled in there out of the wet
to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; Okewood remarked. &ldquo;Who
found him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jake here,&rdquo; said Fink, indicating the
dripping goblin at his side. &ldquo;He had to
open the door of the Lancia to get by, and
blessed if he didn&rsquo;t see a bloke&rsquo;s boot sticking
out from under the rug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gnome, who was one of the washers,
eagerly took up the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It give me a proper turn, I tell yer,&rdquo; he
croaked. &ldquo;I lifts the rug and there &rsquo;e wor,
lyin&rsquo; acrorst the car! An&rsquo; stiff, Mister!
Blimey, like a poker, &rsquo;e wor! An&rsquo; twisted
up, too, somethink crool! &rsquo;Strewth! &rsquo;E
might &rsquo;a&rsquo; bin a &rsquo;oop, &rsquo;e wor that bent! An&rsquo;
&rsquo;is fyce! Gawd! It wor enough to give a
bloke the &rsquo;orrors, strite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he wiped his nose abstractedly on the
back of his hand.</p>
<p>The young man walked across the yard to
the purple car. The doctor had just finished
his examination and had stepped back. The
torch-lamp on the constable&rsquo;s belt lit up the
interior of the Lancia. Its broad white
beam fell upon a figure that was lying half on
the floor, half on the seat. The body was
bent like a bow. The head was flung so far
back that the arched spine scarce touched the
broad cushioned seat, and the body rested on
the head and the heels. The arms were
stretched stiffly out, the hands half closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>As the old washer had said, the face was,
indeed, terrible. The glazed eyes, half open,
were seared with fear, but, in hideous contrast,
the mouth was twisted up into a leery,
fatuous grin. He was a middle-aged man,
inclining to corpulence, with a clean-shaven
face and high cheek-bones, very black eyebrows,
and jet-black hair cut <i>en brosse</i>. He
was wearing a long drab overcoat which,
hanging open, disclosed beneath it a shabby
blue jacket and a pair of old khaki trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strychnine!&rdquo; said the doctor&mdash;he held up
a small medicine bottle, empty and without a
label. &ldquo;That grin is very characteristic.
The <i>risus sardonicus</i>, we call it. And the
muscles are as hard as a board. He&rsquo;s been
dead for hours, I should say. When did the
car come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round about five o&rsquo;clock, George said,&rdquo;
the foreman replied. &ldquo;A young fellow
brought it. Said he&rsquo;d be back later to fetch
it away. My word! He&rsquo;ll get a nasty jar
when he turns up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea who the dead man
is?&rdquo; Okewood asked the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some down-and-out!&rdquo; replied the latter,
dusting his knees. &ldquo;There was a letter in
his pocket addressed to the coroner. The
usual thing. Walking the streets all day, no
money, decided to end it all. And everything
removed that could betray his identity. Seeing
that he used strychnine he might be a
colleague of mine come to grief. Somehow,
for all his rags, he doesn&rsquo;t quite look like a
tramp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent forward into the car again and
sniffed audibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a curious
odour in the car I can&rsquo;t quite place. It
certainly isn&rsquo;t strychnine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Okewood, who had been scanning the body
very closely, had already detected the curious
penetrating odour that yet hung about the
interior of the cabriolet, something sweet,
yet faintly chemical withal.</p>
<p>But now heavy footsteps echoed from
under the archway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s George back,&rdquo; said Fink, looking up.
&ldquo;He nipped across to the police station.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>George, who was one of the mechanics,
bareheaded, his hair shining with wet, was
accompanied by a well-set-up young man
with a trim blond moustache, who wore a
black bowler hat and a heavy overcoat. He
had about him that curious air, a mixture of
extreme self-reliance and rigorous reserve,
which marks the plain-clothes man in every
land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, O&rsquo;Malley!&rdquo; said Okewood
as the young detective came face to face with
him.</p>
<p>The newcomer stared sharply at the
speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If
it isn&rsquo;t Major Desmond Okewood! Are you
on this job, too, Major? They told me you
had retired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have, O&rsquo;Malley!&rdquo; Desmond replied.
&ldquo;No more Secret Service for me! I heard
that you had gone back to the C.I.D. after
you were demobbed from the Intelligence.
I&rsquo;ve only blundered into this by accident.
I&rsquo;ve just come up from Essex in my car.
This is where I garage it when I&rsquo;m in
town . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>O&rsquo;Malley plucked open the door of the
Lancia and began to examine the dead man.
The detective asked a few questions of the
doctor, read and took charge of the letter
found in the pocket of the deceased, and
made some notes in a black book. Then he
beckoned to Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything funny struck you about this
chap, Major?&rdquo; he asked in an undertone.</p>
<p>Desmond looked at O&rsquo;Malley questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask that?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley replied, &ldquo;for a
tramp who has walked the streets all day, it
doesn&rsquo;t strike me that his trousers are very
muddy. His boots are dirty, and the bottoms
of his trousers are wet. But they&rsquo;re not
<i>splashed</i>. Look at mine after walking only
across from the station!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed a spray of mud stains above
the turn-up of his blue serge trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see here!&rdquo; he added. He bent down
and undid the dead man&rsquo;s overcoat. Beneath
it jacket and waistcoat were open and the
unbuttoned shirt showed a glimpse of clean
white skin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the skin of a tramp!&rdquo; the detective
declared.</p>
<p>Again Desmond Okewood gave the young
man one of his enigmatic looks. Then he
turned to the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man dies of strychnine poisoning,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;death is preceded by the most
appalling convulsions, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right!&rdquo; the doctor assented, blinking
through his <i>pince-nez</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would, therefore, look for some
signs of a struggle,&rdquo; Desmond continued,
&ldquo;especially in a confined space like this.
But see for yourself! The body lies stiffly
stretched out, the feet on the floor, the top
of the head touching the back of the hood,
the shoulders all but clear of the seat. Not
even the mat on the floor is disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very singular, I must admit,&rdquo; observed
the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who found the body says it was
covered up with the rug. Isn&rsquo;t that right,
Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, sir,&rdquo; chanted the washer.
&ldquo;Covered up &rsquo;e wor, &rsquo;cept for &rsquo;is foot as stuck
art!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me as odd,&rdquo; remarked Desmond
mildly, &ldquo;that, in such ghastly convulsions
as strychnine poisoning produces, this man
had sufficient presence of mind to arrange
the rug neatly over himself&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and
looked round his audience&mdash;&ldquo;in such a way
as to delay discovery of the body as long as
possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Malley excitedly&mdash;he
was young enough to be still enthusiastic&mdash;&ldquo;you
mean to say you think he was
brought here dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying Desmond turned again
to the open door of the car. He took the
policeman&rsquo;s lamp and turned it on the distorted
features of the dead man, the jet-black
eyebrows and hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything on the right ear?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley replied. &ldquo;Looks like
soap or something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is soap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shaving soap,&rdquo; and
opened his hand in the beam of the light.
Two or three tiny blond curls and a number
of short ends of blond hair lay in the palm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;I found these down the dead man&rsquo;s collar,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;So you see, O&rsquo;Malley,
that your first impression that there is &lsquo;something
funny&rsquo; about this tramp was perfectly
correct!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the detective only looked at him in a
puzzled way. Desmond pushed him forward
to the open door of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sniff, man!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum sort o&rsquo; smell!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Malley, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t see . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hair dye!&rdquo; exclaimed Desmond.</p>
<p>In a flash the young detective whipped
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean . . .&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that this dead man is not a tramp,
but a person of some social standing; that in
life he was not dark and clean-shaven, but
fair with a blond moustache or, more probably,
a blond beard, and that he did not crawl
into this car to die, but was brought here
dead in the Lancia. You can assume, if you
like, that he shaved himself, dyed his hair,
and dressed up as a tramp before taking
poison, in order to conceal his identity, but
you cannot assume that he killed himself here
in this car. Someone brought the body here;
therefore there was collusion in his suicide
. . . if it <i>was</i> suicide . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>O&rsquo;Malley pushed his hat back from his
brow and scratched his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder, eh?&rdquo; he remarked, addressing
no one in particular.</p>
<p>A light footstep sounded on the cobbles
behind the group, and a voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got my car back, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ENTER MISS VERA SLADE</span></h2>
<p>The two men turned about as a young
girl, bareheaded, in a long ermine
coat, slipped between them and laid her hand
on the door of the Lancia. She was a dainty
creature, very fashionably dressed, and little
cloth-of-silver shoes peeped out from beneath
the fringe of her white satin gown. Before
they could stop her, she had pulled the car
door wide. She gave one glance inside the
cabriolet; then, with a little cry, she reeled
back. Desmond Okewood caught her in his
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s . . . it&rsquo;s horrible!&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;What . . . who is that inside my car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large policeman now lumbered up,
panting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Miss Vera Slade,&rdquo; he said to O&rsquo;Malley,
indicating the girl with a fat thumb.
&ldquo;She come into the station this afternoon
and reported as how her Lancia had been
stolen while she was having her lunch at the
Oracle Club in Piccadilly. After you&rsquo;d left
to come here,&rdquo; he added, turning to O&rsquo;Malley,
&ldquo;the sergeant on duty noticed that the
number of the missing car was the same as
that of the Lancia here&mdash;the mechanic as
fetched you reported the number, you know.
So the sergeant sent round to Curzon Street
at once to get Miss Slade. And here she
is . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You identify this car as yours, then?&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Malley asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; she replied with
spirit. &ldquo;I left it outside the Oracle Club
whilst I was lunching there to-day. When I
came out, it had disappeared. I first thought
that Mr. T&ouml;rnedahl had taken it . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. T&ouml;rnedahl?&rdquo; repeated O&rsquo;Malley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The man I had lunching with me.
Towards the end of lunch he was called
away and was absent for some time&mdash;for
about a quarter of an hour. When he came
back to the table, he said he had been called
away urgently on business and would I mind
if he didn&rsquo;t wait for coffee. And with that he
went off. I had my coffee and wrote a couple
of letters, and on going outside found that
my car had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this Mr. T&ouml;rnedahl didn&rsquo;t say
anything about taking your car, did he,
Miss?&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she replied positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why he left you at lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A page came and said a gentleman was
asking for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you see Mr. T&ouml;rnedahl again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to. He was going to
Paris this evening on his way back to Sweden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Now about the car. Did the club
people notice anybody suspicious hanging
round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl opened her clear eyes and looked
at the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t, you know,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;The police won&rsquo;t let you leave a car unattended
in Piccadilly, so we park our cars
in a side street at the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this Mr. T&ouml;rnedahl?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a timber merchant, a Swede. I
met him abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like in appearance?&rdquo; Desmond
asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fair man,&rdquo; the girl replied, &ldquo;with very
blue eyes and a blond beard, a typical Scandinavian
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did this car come in?&rdquo; demanded
O&rsquo;Malley, excitedly, addressing Fink.</p>
<p>George, the mechanic, was thrust forward.
About half-past five, was his answer to the
detective&rsquo;s question. A young man in a dark
suit had brought it. He seemed to be in a
great hurry. He backed the cabriolet into
a place in the line and made off hastily, saying
he would be back before midnight to
fetch the car away. He was a fairish sort
of chap, rather foreign-looking. He had a
long scar on his cheek, high up, near the
right eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he alone?&rdquo; O&rsquo;Malley asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>But here Jake intervened. Coming back
from tea, it appears, he had met the young
man passing under the archway. He had
seen him join a man outside and go off with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was this man like?&rdquo; was O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A biggish sort o&rsquo; chap, &rsquo;e wor,&rdquo; replied
the washer vaguely, &ldquo;an&rsquo; went with a bit of
a limp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anything more precise than this the
most persistent cross-examination of the old
man failed to elicit.</p>
<p>There was a pause. The rain poured
pitilessly down. Mournfully the twelve
strokes of midnight were hammered out
from the steeple of Saint James&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p>Presently Desmond turned to the girl, who
was sheltering beneath Fink&rsquo;s umbrella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dead man in your car,&rdquo; he said diffidently,
&ldquo;do you recognize him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How should I?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to frighten you,&rdquo; the young
man resumed, &ldquo;but I think you ought to look
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>He took the policeman&rsquo;s lamp and opened
the car door. With awe-struck eyes the girl
approached slowly. She glanced quickly
within, then turned away her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks so dreadful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No,
no! I don&rsquo;t know him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite sure?&rdquo; queried the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Malley was about to speak when he felt
a foot firmly press his. Desmond Okewood
was looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we need not detain Miss Slade
any longer,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;If one of your
men could get her a taxi . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>A taxi was procured and they helped her
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall hope to see you again in the morning,
Miss!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Malley as he closed the
door.</p>
<p>When the cab had rattled out of the yard,
he turned to Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you tread on my foot just
now?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never force an identification, O&rsquo;Malley!&rdquo;
Desmond replied with his winning smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; remarked the young detective.
&ldquo;Well, I must be getting back to the station
to see about having him&rdquo;&mdash;he jerked his
head toward the Lancia&mdash;&ldquo;removed. I want
to call in at the Oracle Club on my way, late
as it is. Are you coming along with me,
Major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond Okewood laughed and shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out
of the game for good . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little did he realize when, on those jesting
words, they parted, that, on the contrary,
within twenty-four hours Desmond Okewood,
late of the Secret Service, would have
resumed his old career.</p>
<p class="tb">He slept that night at the flat in Saint
James&rsquo;s Street, which he had kept on since
his marriage as a <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> in town. His
wife, with the Okewood son and heir, was in
Lancashire on a visit to her father, and Desmond
had come up from a brief week-end
with his brother, Francis, in Essex, to resume
his duties at the War Office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>At five minutes to eight on the following
morning the telephone beside his bed rang
deafeningly. At eight o&rsquo;clock, very cross and
sleepy, he put his ear to the burbling receiver.
At a minute past eight he was sitting bolt
upright in bed, alert and eager, listening to a
well-known voice that came to him over the
wire.</p>
<p>It was the Chief who summoned him.
When the head of the Secret Service summons,
there is nothing for it but to obey.
About three-quarters of an hour later, accordingly,
Desmond Okewood entered the
little office, skyed at the top of a lofty building
near Whitehall, and once more saw the
strong, familiar profile silhouetted against
the long window that framed the broad panorama
of river bathed in the morning sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, young fellow!&rdquo; was the well-remembered
greeting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job o&rsquo;
work for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wreck the home, sir,&rdquo; protested
his visitor. &ldquo;You know I promised my wife
when I married that I&rsquo;d drop the game entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief seemed to be absorbed as he
vigorously polished his tortoise-shell spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clubfoot&rsquo;s back!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>And, setting his glasses on his nose, he
calmly surveyed the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Clubfoot! Sometimes a mere name will
instantly put time to flight and bring one
face to face with yesterday. With a pang
like the fleeting anguish of an old bad dream
there flashed back into Desmond&rsquo;s mind the
image of the forbidding cripple whose path
he had twice crossed. The fantastic vicissitudes
of that long and perilous chase through
war-bound Germany, when he and Francis
had so miraculously eluded the long reach
of Dr. Grundt to best him in the end; the
thrilling duel of brains in which he and Clubfoot
had engaged in that breathless treasure
hunt in the South Seas&mdash;how visionary, how
remote those adventures seemed from this
quiet room, perched high above the streets,
with the noise of the birds chirping on the
roof and the dull bourdon of the traffic drifting
with the winter sunshine through the
open window!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Clubfoot! The name stirred memories of
high adventure in the Silent Corps. For two
years the Chief&rsquo;s small and devoted body of
helpers, all picked men, had not known the
Okewoods who soon after the war had retired
from the Service. From time to time
Desmond had felt the tug at the heartstrings.
Now and then in his room at the
War Office, in the stay-at-home billet which
the Chief had secured for him, an odd restlessness
seized him when an Intelligence report
came his way and he read that &ldquo;X, a reliable
agent, reports from Helsingfors,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;A trustworthy observer forwards a statement
from Angora . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>But these were vague longings that a
round of golf or a brisk game of tennis
would dispel. The name of Clubfoot, however,
was a definite challenge. He felt his
breath come faster, his pulse quicken, as he
glanced across the desk at the bold, strong
face confronting him with an enigmatical
smile playing about the firm, rather grim
mouth. He knew then that the Chief had
sent for him with a purpose and that, before
the interview was at an end, the Service
would claim him once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was written,&rdquo; the Chief resumed,
&ldquo;that you two should meet again. Your
brilliant little experiment in practical criminology
last night makes it perfectly clear to
me, my dear Okewood, that you are the only
man to tackle old Clubfoot in his reincarnation
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond stared at the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean . . .?&rdquo; he began, and
broke off. &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
striking his open palm with his fist, &ldquo;one of
the men at the garage said something about
seeing a big lame man go off with the young
man who drove up in the stolen Lancia
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me!&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;Three
days ago a certain Mr. Gustaf T&ouml;rnedahl, a
Swedish merchant . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&ouml;rnedahl?&rdquo; cried Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; ordered the Chief. &ldquo;A certain
Mr. T&ouml;rnedahl, who rendered this country
various services of a highly confidential nature
in the war, came to see me. He was in a
mortal funk. He solemnly declared that,
since his arrival in London about ten days
before, two separate attempts had been made
on his life. A man had tried to knife him
down at the Docks, and, a few days later,
so he assured me, a fellow in a car had deliberately
sought to run him down in Jermyn
Street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;He asked for police protection and, because
I had reasons for taking his story even
more seriously than he did himself, I gave it
to him. At seven o&rsquo;clock yesterday evening
the plain-clothes man detailed to shadow him
was found drugged, lying halfway down the
steps of the Down Street Tube Station,
which, as you know, is one of the loneliest
places in London. And shortly after midnight
the Yard rings up to tell me that a man,
believed to be T&ouml;rnedahl, with his beard
shaved off and his hair dyed black, had been
found poisoned in a car in Pump Yard, Saint
James&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> the little lady&rsquo;s friend, then?&rdquo;
said Desmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was. He is the fourth victim of the
most amazing campaign of vengeance directed
against those who rendered our Secret
Service notable aid in the war. And in each
case&mdash;mark well my words, Okewood&mdash;a
clubfooted or a lame man has lurked in the
background, never very clearly seen, never
precisely identified. When Sir Wetherby
Soukes, the chemist, with whose work in detecting
the German invisible inks you are
familiar, committed suicide the other day,
his callers, on the afternoon in question, included
a certain Dr. Simon Nadon, stated to
be a French scientist, <i>who had a clubfoot</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you read in the newspapers of
the unexplained death of Colonel Branxe,
who did so well in the counter-espionage.
Poor Branxe, you remember, was found on
the fifth green at Great Chadfold with a
knife in his back. Well, in the sand of an
adjacent bunker the police discovered the
footprint of a <i>lame man</i>&mdash;you know, with
one footprint turned almost at right angles
to the other. And lastly, in the inexplicable
affair of Fawcett Wilbur, who looked after
our end in Rumania during the German occupation,
his companion, when he jumped
in front of a train at Charing Cross Station,
was a Rumanian doctor <i>who was a clubfooted
man</i>! But every time, mark you, the
shadowy figure of this lame man has simply
faded away without leaving a trace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>He broke off, and leaning back in his big
chair, scrutinized the keen and resolute face
that confronted him across the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like all Germans, old Clubfoot is a man
of method,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;He is working
upwards, Okewood. To-morrow it may be
your turn, or perhaps he&rsquo;ll have a shot at
your brother, Francis; and ultimately it will
be me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mouth had grown very grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, my boy. We can&rsquo;t take it
lying down. But you realize it&rsquo;s going to
be a dangerous business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond Okewood nodded. &ldquo;No clues, I
take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing essential!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little twinkle in the young
man&rsquo;s blue eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;If we
can&rsquo;t go to him, we&rsquo;ll have to bring him to us.
This is my idea, sir . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>For two hours thereafter the Chief&rsquo;s door
was barred to callers and a long list of engagements
completely dislocated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Two evenings later, Vera Slade dined with
Desmond Okewood at the corner table of the
grill-room of the Nineveh Hotel, which was
always reserved for Desmond when he was
in town. In a high-necked pale-green gown
fresh from Paris the girl looked most attractive.
Eyebrows just aslant gave a
charming suggestion of archness to her piquant
face with its dark eyes, rather wistful
mouth, and fine skin, framed in raven-black
hair. Woman-like, her spirits rose to the
interest which, as she clearly saw, she had
aroused in her host. His pressure of her
hand as he greeted her had lasted just long
enough to tell her that her appearance was
an undoubted success.</p>
<p>He had asked her to dine with him to discuss
the latest developments in the mystery
of the purple cabriolet. But, as usually happens,
it was not until the coffee came that the
matter actually arose. Then it was Vera
who brought it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I told
you yesterday I would dine with you, I&rsquo;d no
idea what a celebrity was to entertain me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond, who was lighting his cigar,
raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t seen yesterday&rsquo;s
<i>Daily Telegram</i>?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Desmond made a wry face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough about it, God knows,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t actually seen
the paragraph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it here,&rdquo; said Vera, and produced
a cutting from her gold and platinum bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sensational developments are expected,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she read out, &ldquo;&lsquo;in the case of the
mysterious stranger who poisoned himself in
a Lancia car at Pump Yard, Saint James&rsquo;s.
From the circumstance that Major Desmond
Okewood, one of the most successful agents
of the British Intelligence in the war, has
been put in charge of the investigation, it
is surmised that the mystery has a political
as well as a criminal aspect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head prettily at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky you didn&rsquo;t deign to take <i>me</i>
into your confidence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or you
would have certainly declared that a woman
had given you away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if I know where the devil this
infernal rag got hold of the news,&rdquo; Desmond
remarked forlornly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t breathed a
word to a soul. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m
going out to the country this evening to talk
things over with my brother Francis . . .
I want him to help me in the inquiry. That&rsquo;s
why I asked you if you&rsquo;d mind dining at
seven. My boss carpeted me over this infernal
par and properly washed my head.
Apparently the Home Office had been on to
him. Look at this, issued to yesterday&rsquo;s
evening papers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out of his pocket a sheet of coarse
greenish paper with a printed heading &ldquo;Press
Association.&rdquo; He handed it to Vera. It was
marked &ldquo;Private and confidential,&rdquo; and ran
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Notice to Editors</span></p>
<p>The Press Association is asked by the Home
Office to make a special request to the newspapers
to make no further reference to Major Desmond
Okewood&rsquo;s inquiry into the Pump Yard case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But how thrilling!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.
&ldquo;Then what the <i>Daily Telegram</i> says is
right. It <i>is</i> a political crime, then? Tell me,
has the dead man been identified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through a cloud of blue smoke Desmond
smiled at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once bitten, twice shy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I can&rsquo;t say anything about it, Miss
Slade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl made a little grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be discreet with <i>me</i>, Major
Okewood,&rdquo; she said softly. She raised her
dark almond-shaped eyes and let them rest
for a moment on his face. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you trust
me? Won&rsquo;t you let me help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond looked at her doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult,&rdquo; he remarked, pulling
on his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were you going to your brother&rsquo;s
to-night?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to catch the nine-ten from
Liverpool Street. He lives on the high
ground above Brentwood, in Essex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vera leaned across the table. With her
soft white arms stretched out before her,
she made an appealing picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not let me drive you down in the
car? Then we three could talk the whole
thing over. <i>Do</i> let me help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Desmond. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
rather an idea! But look here, you&rsquo;ll have
to promise to be very discreet about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; she cried joyously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as
mute as the silent wife. That&rsquo;s settled, then?
Now I&rsquo;m going to take a taxi to Curzon
Street and change my frock. I&rsquo;ll be back
here with the car in half an hour if you&rsquo;ll
wait for me in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of a long drive through the
night with such a charming girl as Vera
Slade seemed to please Desmond Okewood,
for he was smiling happily to himself as he
sat in the &ldquo;Nineveh&rdquo; lounge awaiting her
return.</p>
<p>Within forty minutes the hall porter
fetched him out. The purple cabriolet stood
throbbing at the door, Vera, in a <i>chic</i> little
felt <i>cloche</i> and a blanket coat, at the wheel.
It was a damp, raw night, and in the Mile
End Road the tram-lines were so greasy that
the girl, without hesitation, turned off into
a network of side streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know my way round here,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I used to drive a car in these parts
during the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at last she slowed down, peering out
of the open window at her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must have missed the turning
just now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In front of them, through the rain-spotted
driving-glass, the blank wall of a <i>cul-de-sac</i>
was discernible. Vera stopped the car. She
was busy with the gears. Suddenly the
doors on either side were plucked violently
open. Desmond caught a glimpse of the girl
torn bodily out from behind the driving-wheel,
then a heavy woollen muffler fell over
his face from behind and strong arms pulled
him backwards.</p>
<p>A voice whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sound, or you&rsquo;re a dead man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was unable to speak; indeed, he
was almost choking with the thick cloth that
invisible hands thrust into his mouth. He
felt the sharp rasp of cords on his wrists and
ankles; his eyes were blindfolded; he was
raised up; for an instant the raw night air
struck chill on his cheek, then he was thrown
down unceremoniously into another car,
which immediately began to move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>For the best part of an hour, so it seemed
to him, the journey lasted. The frequent
changing of gears and the many stops told
him that they were going through traffic.
It meant, therefore, that they had returned
to London. Then came a halt longer than
the rest. He heard the car door open; he
was once more lifted and carried upstairs,
or so he judged by the laboured breathing of
his unseen bearers. He heard a key turn in
a lock; he was dropped in a chair. Then the
gag was pulled out of his mouth and the
bandage removed from his eyes.</p>
<p>Before him, at a low desk, The Man with
the Clubfoot was sitting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MAN WITH THE CLUBFOOT</span></h2>
<p>The room was lighted only by a green-shaded
reading-lamp, which, standing
on the desk between Desmond Okewood and
Grundt, threw a dim, mysterious light on
the saturnine visage of the cripple. The bristling
iron-grey hair and low forehead, the hot
and fearless eyes under the beetling brows,
were in shadow; but a band of yellow-greenish
light, falling athwart the face, revealed
clearly the heavy clipped moustache, baring
the discoloured teeth, and the massive jaw.
From the cigar grasped in the great hairy
fist clenched, as though in defiance, on the
desk, a thin spiral of blue smoke rose aloft.
The monstrous right boot was concealed
from view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>He had changed but little, Desmond reflected
as he looked at him. The gross body
was a little fuller, the iron-grey bristles were
perhaps more thickly sprinkled with white;
but there was nothing in the hostile, challenging
attitude of the man that told of the
misfortunes that had overcome his race. He
was as before the Prussian beast, unchanging,
unchangeable, revelling in his strength,
glorying in his power, ferocious, relentless,
unpardoning.</p>
<p>For a full minute he did not speak. Obviously
he gloated over the situation. It was
as though he were reluctant to forgo a moment
of his malicious enjoyment. His dark
and cruel eyes, lighted with a spiteful fire,
rested with a look of taunting interrogation
upon the young man, and, when presently he
raised his cigar to his mouth, he turned it
over between his thick and pursed-up lips
like some great beast of prey licking its
chops.</p>
<p>At last he broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieber Freund,&rdquo; he said in a soft, purring
voice, &ldquo;this is indeed a pleasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wagged his head as though in sheer
enjoyment of the sight of his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, bound
hand and foot, sprawling awkwardly in his
chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;You always were a disconcerting person,
lieber Okewood,&rdquo; he remarked, his little
finger flicking the ash of his cigar into a tray.
&ldquo;I had not reached your name on my little
list&mdash;no, not by a round dozen or so! In
fact, you find me in a considerable quandary.
To be perfectly frank with you, teurer junger
Herr, I have not yet decided how I shall
put you to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed his cigar between his fleshy lips
and drew on it luxuriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the lad of mettle that I know you
to be,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you are remarkably
taciturn this evening. If I remember rightly,
you were more talkative in the past! Perhaps,
though, the trifling measure of restraint
I have been compelled to lay upon you
embarrasses you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>His black-turfed eyebrows bent to a frown
and his eyes flashed hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking no more chances with you,
young man!&rdquo; he said in a voice of dangerous
softness.</p>
<p>Desmond Okewood struggled erect. Instantly
a young man appeared from behind
his chair. He was a typical fair young German,
his right cheek scored with a long white
duelling scar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be, Heinrich!&rdquo; said Grundt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of your hired assassins, eh, Herr
Doktor?&rdquo; observed Desmond. &ldquo;I believe you
will find it safer in this country to continue
to commit murder by proxy . . . at any
rate for a time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little flush of anger crept into the cripple&rsquo;s
black-tufted cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hardly in a position to be sarcastic
at my expense!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Desmond shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a bad blunder, Herr Doktor,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I greatly fear that by kidnapping
and murdering me you&rsquo;re going to
bring a hornet&rsquo;s nest about your ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be!&rdquo; returned Clubfoot grimly.
&ldquo;It is unfortunate that you will not be there
to see it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>While they were talking, Desmond had
stolen furtive glances about the room. Furnished
unpretentiously enough, it had the
look of a dining-room; but the fumed oak
table had been pushed back against the wall
and the chairs that went with it aligned in
a row on either side of the apartment. The
obvious newness of the furniture and the
cheap and garish carpet suggested a furnished
house or lodgings. The only thing
in the room that had any pretence to good
taste was a handsome Jacobean oak press
with perfectly plain panelled doors that stood
against the wall behind Clubfoot&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>The house was as silent as the grave.
Strain his ear as he would, Desmond could
detect no sound, not even of the traffic of the
London streets, other than the ticking of a
cheap clock on the mantelpiece which showed
the time to be five minutes to eleven.</p>
<p>Now Clubfoot noticed the listening look on
the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t buoy yourself up with false hopes,
Okewood!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My retreat is truly
rural. One never hears a sound here after
dark, nor, on the other hand, does any noise
ever penetrate beyond these walls. I&rsquo;ve
tested it, and I know! When that poor Mr.
T&ouml;rnedahl had a whiskey-and-soda with me
the other afternoon, I was glad to find that,
despite the proverb, <i>these</i> walls have no ears.
With deplorable carelessness I had entirely
forgotten that the victims of strychnine
poisoning emit the most distressing screams
in their convulsions. Heinrich, who is less
experienced than I am, was quite upset.
Weren&rsquo;t you, Heinrich? You were quite
right, mein Junge, I should have used
cyanide of potassium. As for you, Okewood,&rdquo;
he added in a sudden and surprising
access of fury, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hang you! As
an example to other spies! There&rsquo;s a nice
quiet death for you! Heinrich, will you see
to it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The young man with the scarred face went
out noiselessly. Desmond&rsquo;s eyes were fixed
on the clock. The hands were creeping past
the hour of eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll let the girl go
free, Grundt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubfoot laughed stridently. &ldquo;And leave
a Crown witness behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his head. &ldquo;Heinrich!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>A trap in the ceiling had opened. Two
ends of rope, one furnished with a stout
noose, came dangling down. The young
German&rsquo;s face appeared in the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Doktor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Karl and Grossmann bring up the
young lady to witness the execution!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sehr wohl, Herr Doktor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubfoot turned to Desmond. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
settle the girl later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You . . . you ruffian,&rdquo; exclaimed
Desmond. &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve done it before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubfoot, his big body shaking with silent
laughter, did not reply, but stood up. Once
again Desmond, despite his desperate plight,
marvelled at the prodigious size of the man,
his immensely massive shoulders and his
great arms, as sinewy, as disproportionately
long, as the arms of some giant orang-outang.</p>
<p>The door opened and Heinrich appeared.
Behind him, escorted by two other men, was
Vera. Desmond had no time to exchange a
word with her, for the three men, on a sign
from Grundt, instantly hustled him under
the open trap and adjusted the noose about
his neck. Now Grundt was speaking; but
Desmond did not look at him. His eyes were
on the clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;To show you that I do not act by proxy,&rdquo;
Clubfoot snarled, &ldquo;I am going to hang you
with my own hands. And when your cursed
brother&rsquo;s turn arrives, I shall tell him, before
he dies&mdash;and his death shall be terrible, I
promise you, because of that bullet he once
fired into me&mdash;I shall tell him how you dangled,
throttling, from that beam above. I owe
your country a grudge, you snivelling Englishman,
and, bei Gott! I&rsquo;m going to have
my pound of flesh. Every time my vengeance
falls, I exult! Donnerwetter! If you had
heard Branxe grunt when I gave him the
knife! If you had heard how that dog Wilbur
screamed when I thrust him before the
incoming train! And now, bei Gott! it&rsquo;s
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grasped the rope. As the long spatulate
fingers closed on it, Desmond saw the
bony sinews stretch taut among the black
thatch on the back of the cripple&rsquo;s hands.
He heard his heavy boot thump on the
floor . . .</p>
<p>A voice cried from the doorway:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up, Grundt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Then, with a sudden smash of glass, the
room was plunged into darkness. With a
deafening explosion a pistol spoke, a woman
screamed piercingly, and a door slammed.
Then suddenly the room was brightly lighted.
The place seemed full of men. Francis Okewood,
in motor-cyclist overalls heavily
splashed with mud, was at Desmond&rsquo;s side,
swiftly slashing at the ropes that bound him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Francis!&rdquo; murmured Desmond.
&ldquo;I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t fail me. But, dash it
all, you cut it rather fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked rapidly round the room. His
glance took in Vera, pale and affrighted, and
her escort, surrounded by plain-clothes men.
But of Clubfoot and of Heinrich there was
no sign. Even as he looked, from the Jacobean
cupboard, the doors of which stood
open, a large, red-faced man hastily scrambled.
Desmond knew him of old. It was
Detective-Inspector Manderton, of Scotland
Yard. Behind him followed O&rsquo;Malley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much afraid he&rsquo;s given us the
slip,&rdquo; the Inspector said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret passage
leading to the next house with a locked
steel door between. Come on, some of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he hurried out, taking two of his men
with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Major Okewood,&rdquo; Vera cried out suddenly,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you please explain to these men
who I am? They want to handcuff me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond walked stiffly, for his legs were
yet numb from his bonds, to the corner
where, between two plain-clothes men, the
girl was struggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vera Sokoloff,&rdquo; he said, looking sternly
at her, &ldquo;have you forgotten me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the colour drained out of her
cheeks, leaving only a little grotesque dab of
rouge on either side. Valiantly she sought
to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What . . . what do you mean?&rdquo;
she faltered. &ldquo;That is not my name . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your name in 1919 when I knew
you as a spy in Helsingfors,&rdquo; Desmond retorted.
&ldquo;Fortunately my disguise was a
good one or you would not have walked so
easily into the trap I laid for you. My
brother and his men have followed us every
step of the way to-night. I could not expect
you to know that I sent that notice to the
<i>Daily Telegram</i> myself . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent it?&rdquo; cried the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, in the hope that Clubfoot
would use you to decoy me to him as you
lured poor T&ouml;rnedahl into the trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; the girl flashed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . But,&rdquo; Desmond continued unperturbed,
&ldquo;I confess I feel rather mortified
that you should have thought me so insanely
indiscreet as to take a stranger like yourself
into my confidence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an abominable outrage!&rdquo; stormed
the girl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad, I think, with your talk
of . . . of spies. I&rsquo;m English . . .
I have powerful friends . . . I . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the telephonist
at your club is a sharp little cockney. He
was much intrigued to hear two days ago
a telephone conversation between Miss Vera
Slade and a certain post-office call-box in
West Kensington beginning and ending with
a number. &lsquo;A message for Number One
from Twenty Three,&rsquo; you said, and you went
on to say that T&ouml;rnedahl was lunching with
you at one o&rsquo;clock and that Number One
should come quickly. The car, you added,
was round at the back of the club . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and looked at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Vera, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you were more
prudent than that at Helsingfors. You&rsquo;re
losing your grip! The English are not so
stupid as they look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a convulsive shudder she covered her
face with her hands and fell a-sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They threatened me,&rdquo; she wailed in German.
&ldquo;I could not help myself, Herr Major!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door burst open. Manderton appeared,
hot and angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got clean away!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and him with
a game leg! Damn it, he&rsquo;s a deep one!&rdquo;
And he plumped into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francis, old son,&rdquo; remarked Desmond to
his brother, &ldquo;do you know what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy it, Des.!&rdquo; grinned Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brothers Okewood,&rdquo; Desmond announced
gravely, &ldquo;are back on the job!&rdquo;</p>

each other across the table in the snug
living-room of Desmond&rsquo;s little service flat
in Saint James&rsquo;s. The curtains were drawn,
for it was five o&rsquo;clock of a winter evening;
and the tantalus, siphon, and glasses which
filled the tray between them suggested that
the two brothers were prepared to celebrate,
in their peculiar fashion, the rites of the
hour. However, a tea-wagon, appropriately
decked out, that stood near the window, indicated
that a visitor of less masculine tastes
was expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Desmond, resuming his
train of thought which he had interrupted to
light a cigarette, &ldquo;if old Clubfoot, as you say,
has any money, I&rsquo;d like to know where he
gets it from, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Francis grunted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it all right,
don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;as Patricia Maxwell
will tell you in a minute . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided she hasn&rsquo;t forgotten the appointment,&rdquo;
said Desmond, looking at the
clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here to the tick,&rdquo; his brother replied,
&ldquo;unless she has altered from what she
used to be when I knew her in the States!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of Monica&rsquo;s, didn&rsquo;t you say she
was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Monica was Francis Okewood&rsquo;s American
wife.)</p>
<p>Francis nodded. &ldquo;They went to the same
school in America. We met her again last
year in California. That&rsquo;s why she came
to me with this extraordinary story of hers.
But here she is, I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Batts, the valet of the flats, appeared
at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Maxwell!&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Patricia Maxwell was of that not uncommon
type of American girl who in the daytime
looks as though she had stepped out of
the current number of a fashion paper, and
in the evening as though she would appear
in the forthcoming issue. From the crown
of her little brown hat to the sole of her
neatly shod foot she was absolutely flawless,
perfectly coiffed, perfectly dressed, perfectly
gloved, perfectly shod. An orphan, her more
than comfortable means enabled her, through
frequent visits to Europe, to appreciate her
country to the full, besides permitting her to
admit with impunity her real age which was
on the right side of thirty. Her little London
house, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the
Park, was, like herself, a gem of good taste.
She knew everybody and liked almost everybody,
and everybody liked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is the famous brother?&rdquo; she said
when Francis introduced Desmond. &ldquo;If you
only knew how perfectly thrilled I am to meet
you two together! But you&rsquo;ll have to promise
not to laugh at my story, Major Okewood!
I dare say it&rsquo;ll seem just silly to
<i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Miss Maxwell,&rdquo; Desmond
answered with his rather languid air,
&ldquo;I am honestly quite extraordinarily curious
to hear it. Believe me, a yarn that&rsquo;ll interest
this brother of mine must be something well
out of the ordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>And over the tea-cups in that tranquil
room, while outside the cars and taxis purred
and hooted up and down the slope of Saint
James&rsquo;s Street, she told her story. Long before
she had done, Desmond, nursing his
knee, his eyes fixed on the speaker&rsquo;s face, had
let his cigarette go out as it dangled from his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect your brother has told you,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m a collector of enamels. I
guess it&rsquo;s a kind of hobby of mine. Every
time a special piece comes up for sale in London
or Paris or Vienna, one of the dealers
is pretty sure to notify me, and if it&rsquo;s any
way possible, I go along and see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the other day a dealer friend of
mine called me on the &rsquo;phone and told me
that a Russian ikon&mdash;you know, one of these
sacred pictures you see in Russian homes and
churches&mdash;was to be sold at Blackie&rsquo;s. It
was a beautiful piece, he said, with the figures
of the Madonna and Child in green-and-blue
enamel under a silver sheeting&mdash;probably
twelfth or thirteenth century work.
He thought it would fetch under a hundred
pounds and wanted to bid for me. But I like
auctions and I said I&rsquo;d go myself. I went
into Blackie&rsquo;s the day before the sale and fell
in love with the ikon at once. It was quite
small, not above about nine inches by six,
I guess, and heavy for its size, the silver covering
cut out so as to show the enamel figures
underneath&mdash;you know the way it is&mdash;black
with age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yesterday was the day of the sale,
and S&uuml;sslein, my little dealer, went along
with me. The ikon was part of the collection
of some Russian Count&mdash;I forget the name&mdash;one
of the <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> from the Russian
Revolution who had served with Denikin
against the Bolsheviks. We sat there all
through the afternoon and by the time the
ikon came up the hall was three-quarters
empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of the dealers started the bidding at
ten guineas, and between three or four of
us we ran it up to seventy-five. Then the
others began to drop out, and by the time
we&rsquo;d got to a hundred there were only three
of us left&mdash;Harris, who buys for Lord Boraston,
me, and a funny-looking little runt of
a man with a grey chin-beard and spectacles.
He wasn&rsquo;t one of the ordinary dealers, so I
sent S&uuml;sslein to find out just who he was.
When he came back he whispered to me he
was a man called Achille Saumergue, who
was believed to be a Frenchman. Nobody
had ever seen him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At two hundred guineas we topped
Harris&rsquo;s limit, and he passed away, leaving
me and old Saumergue to it. He and I kept
on quietly tossing the ball to and fro until&mdash;I&rsquo;m
cutting this all short, you know&mdash;I
brought him up all standing with an advance
of fifty guineas on his three hundred and
fifty. I jumped the price up a bit because
Hermann, the auctioneer, who&rsquo;s an old
friend of mine, kept looking at the clock, and
I knew the poor man was dying to shut down
and go home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then old Saumergue asked if he might
telephone&mdash;I suppose he&rsquo;d reached his limit.
As he went out, I noticed that S&uuml;sslein went
after him. He&rsquo;s pretty slick, and I guessed
he meant to pick up what he could outside the
telephone box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, my gracious! in two minutes my
little friend was back in no end of a way.
Why, the man was so white I thought he was
ill! He started telling me a long story
about old Saumergue buying in the ikon for
some Russian family where it was an heirloom,
that it was really a rather inferior
specimen, and a lot of stuff like that. That&rsquo;s
the line of talk dealers always hand out when
they want to shoo you off a piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t go any with me, Major
Okewood. I wanted that little old ikon, and
I meant to have it. But do you think what
I wanted mattered? Say, for about five
minutes that little Jew never let up knocking
that holy picture, saying the price was
ridiculous, and how I must be plumb crazy
to bid four hundred guineas for a thing that
wasn&rsquo;t worth above forty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Hermann picked up his hammer
again, I just waved the dealer aside. That
old skate and I went at it once more. Everybody
in the place was crowded round us now,
sort of in two camps&mdash;you know the way it
is&mdash;and it was so quiet you could almost
hear a pin drop, I guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May I say four hundred and fifty
guineas? It&rsquo;s a lovely piece,&rsquo; Hermann calls
out in his soft voice, and the old man nods.
He was standing up, very serious, blinking
through his spectacles, but I could see his
hands shaking with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Five hundred!&rsquo; I said from my place
just under the desk&mdash;they had given me a
Heppelwhite chair from the Zossenberg sale
next week to sit in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And twenty-five!&rsquo; says the old man with
a kind of gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fifty?&rsquo; asks Hermann, looking at me.
I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&uuml;sslein pulled my sleeve. &lsquo;Let him have
the ikon!&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;It don&rsquo;t matter
any to you, a common old thing like that!
For God&rsquo;s sake, let him have it, Miss Maxwell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Six hundred!&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Any advance on six hundred?&rsquo; asks
Hermann, and brings his hammer down
pretty sharply. &lsquo;Six hundred guineas I&rsquo;m
bid. For the first time! It&rsquo;s getting late,
and we all want to go home, I&rsquo;m sure. For
the second time . . .&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seven hundred!&rsquo; says the old Frenchman
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time S&uuml;sslein was whispering in
my ear. The man was all worked up.
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to let him have it,&rsquo; he kept on
saying. &lsquo;Take my advice, Miss Maxwell,
and let the thing be. It&rsquo;ll bring you no luck!
Believe me, I know what I&rsquo;m saying!&rsquo; His
voice was shaking and his eyes were starting
out of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I meant to have that ikon, though,
by this, the price was &rsquo;way beyond my figure.
The end came quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall we say eight hundred?&rsquo; asks Hermann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nodded. With that the old man turned
on his heel and walked straight out of the
place. The ikon was mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&uuml;sslein didn&rsquo;t say any more. He left
me there. He seemed a changed man. And
I took the ikon home. As I told S&uuml;sslein,
I had it all planned out where I was going
to hang it in the little space between the
panels over the desk in my boudoir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;This morning, before I was up, S&uuml;sslein
was round at the house. He said he wanted
to speak to me urgently. He had come, he
told me, on behalf of a client to offer me a
thousand pounds for the ikon. I told him I
wasn&rsquo;t selling. He asked me what I would
take. I told him I didn&rsquo;t intend to part with
my treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My client,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is most anxious,
for family reasons, to acquire the ikon,&rsquo; and
he offered me two thousand guineas, and
then three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time I was getting pretty peeved,
and I told S&uuml;sslein so. &lsquo;If your client can
prove to my satisfaction,&rsquo; I told him, &lsquo;that
this ikon really is an heirloom in his family,
it&rsquo;s a different matter. At present it looks to
me as though you and he had realized too
late that I had got on to something pretty
good. I&rsquo;m not selling, and you can tell your
client so!&rsquo; And with that I sent him about
his business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a lot of trouble to get rid of him.
Like so many dealers, he seemed to think
it was all a question of money. He couldn&rsquo;t
realize that I&rsquo;d never part with anything
that went so well with the dull green wainscot
of my boudoir unless, of course, they
could prove to me that the ikon had been
stolen or something of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your dealer pal didn&rsquo;t tell you the name
of his client?&rdquo; asked Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him, of course, but he said he
was not at liberty to reveal it. But it didn&rsquo;t
matter any, for, about an hour later, he
arrived in person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The client?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. A Russian, a certain Dr. Madjaroff.
I was sick and tired of the whole
thing, so I told the butler to say I was busy.
But he said he&rsquo;d wait till I was disengaged.
So, just to get rid of him, I saw him. My
dear, he was the most extraordinary-looking
person, a vast man with a great bushy black
beard and a clubfoot . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a crash from the fender. Desmond
Okewood had suddenly dropped the
knee he had been hugging and overset the
fire irons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;He spoke in French,&rdquo; Patricia Maxwell
went on. &ldquo;He said that, through a misunderstanding,
Monsieur Saumergue, who
had been bidding for him at Blackie&rsquo;s yesterday,
had failed to secure the ikon. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;I am prepared to pay handsomely for
the mistake. I will now write you my cheque
for three thousand five hundred guineas!&rsquo;
And he actually produced a cheque-book and
a fountain pen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I didn&rsquo;t want to sell. But do
you think he&rsquo;d take &lsquo;no&rsquo; for an answer? Not
on your life! &lsquo;Would I name my own figure?&rsquo;
he said, and when I stood up and repeated
that I meant to keep the ikon and
that he was wasting his time, he offered me
first five thousand guineas and at last, by
stages, six thousand five hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, that man rather frightened
me. I&rsquo;m supposed to be a pretty determined
sort of person myself, but never in my life
have I run up against such a dominating
personality as this Dr. Madjaroff. He was
so big and hairy with the vitality of some
great animal like a buffalo or . . . or a
rhinoceros.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I turned down his offer of six
thousand five hundred guineas, he bent his
dark bushy eyebrows at me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Maxwell,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve set my
heart on that ikon. You&rsquo;ve got to let me
have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I was sorry, but it was quite
impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve offered you thirty, fifty times its
value,&rsquo; he returned. &lsquo;Believe me, you will
be well advised to accept my offer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My mind is made up,&rsquo; I replied, and
rang to show him the interview was at an
end. &lsquo;The ikon is not for sale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, the queerest change came
over that old guy! All his hair seemed to
bristle and his eyes just burnt like two hot
coals. He raised up his stick&mdash;he had a
crutch-stick that he walked with&mdash;as though
to strike me, then turned his back on me and
hobbled out of the house. My! I tell you I
felt relieved to see him go . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond broke in quickly. &ldquo;I hope you
didn&rsquo;t leave the ikon hanging up in your
house?&rdquo; he said. His languid air had given
way to a brisk and eager manner. His steely
blue eyes searched the girl&rsquo;s face as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no!&rdquo; said Miss Maxwell. &ldquo;As a
matter of fact, I brought it along to show
you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>So saying she opened her capacious leathern
handbag and produced a flat brown
paper parcel. Unwrapping it, she drew
forth the ikon, which she handed to Desmond.</p>
<p>He bore it quickly to the electric-light
bracket by the fire-place and carefully examined
it. Once or twice he balanced it in
his hand as though appraising the weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, why do you suppose,&rdquo; the American
asked, &ldquo;that this Russian is so dead set
on getting hold of this old ikon? It&rsquo;s beautiful
work and all that, of course, but it&rsquo;s not
worth six thousand five hundred guineas or
the half or even the quarter of the eight
hundred I paid . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Desmond had turned away and was
talking to his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to make sure,&rdquo; he was saying.
&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll come round at once and see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis Okewood stepped across to a desk
in the corner on which the telephone stood
and asked for a number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Maxwell, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
S&uuml;sslein&rsquo;s number!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>But Francis held up his hand for silence,
the telephone receiver to his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to Mr. S&uuml;sslein,&rdquo; he said,
and stood listening for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;No, I hadn&rsquo;t
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver and faced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&uuml;sslein was found dead in his office
after lunch!&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; exclaimed the American in a
shocked voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had hanged himself,&rdquo; Francis answered
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it!&rdquo; said Desmond, looking
up from his study of the ikon. &ldquo;This means
that The Man with the Clubfoot is at his old
tricks again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE IKON OF SMOLENSK</span></h2>
<p>Since his dramatic reappearance in the
affair of the purple cabriolet, Dr.
Grundt had passed wholly from Desmond
Okewood&rsquo;s ken. The villa, on the outskirts
of Harlesden, to which Desmond had been
carried, together with the house next door,
had been taken furnished in the name of a
certain Mr. Blund, which alias covered the
identity of a gentleman only too well known
to Scotland Yard; but neither he nor Grundt
had returned to it. Though the Chief and
his young men remained on the constant
alert, though the police kept watch at all the
ports, there was no sign either of Clubfoot
or of his associates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The Special Branch at Scotland Yard took
the view that Grundt had fled the country.
It was, indeed, remarkable that, easily identifiable
as he was by reason of his monstrous
deformed foot, he should have contrived to
vanish without trace. In corroboration of
the police theory was the circumstance that
Clubfoot&rsquo;s campaign of vengeance against
the British Secret Service, its agents and
helpers, which had already claimed some half
a dozen victims, was undoubtedly suspended.</p>
<p>Francis Okewood was disposed to believe
that Grundt&rsquo;s narrow escape from justice
on the last occasion had disinclined him from
further adventures; but Desmond was sceptical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clubfoot intends to get back on you and
me, Francis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if he&rsquo;s quiescent
it means only that he&rsquo;s planning some fresh
deviltry or that he&rsquo;s short of funds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After their startling discovery of S&uuml;sslein&rsquo;s
suicide, Desmond asked his brother to
escort Miss Maxwell home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to borrow your ikon for an
hour or two,&rdquo; he told the girl, &ldquo;and, if it
won&rsquo;t shock your sense of propriety, to ask
you to put Francis up for the night . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia let her bright brown eyes rest
inquiringly on Desmond&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not both of you? There&rsquo;s plenty
of room . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I shan&rsquo;t want a bed at all!&rdquo; replied
the other enigmatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think something&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo;
she challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since you bought this ikon, Miss
Maxwell,&rdquo; was Desmond&rsquo;s impassive reply,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture to say there has not been a
minute in which your life has not been in
danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What
about your famous British police? Do
you mean to tell me that foreign gunmen like
this Madjaroff guy are allowed to run round
and scare folks into hanging themselves?
I expect, if the truth were known, S&uuml;sslein
was in money difficulties, poor little
man . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a matter for the police, Miss
Maxwell,&rdquo; said Desmond. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d left
this ikon hanging up in your boudoir, I&rsquo;d
lay a small shade of odds that you wouldn&rsquo;t
have found it on your return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a glint of strong white teeth Patricia
Maxwell laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re trying to scare me!&rdquo; she
affirmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; returned Desmond. He
pointed to the desk. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the telephone.
Just for the fun of the thing, call up your
house and see whether anything has happened
in your absence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His perfect self-possession and matter-of-factness
sobered the girl. She looked at him
curiously, then went slowly to the telephone.
The two brothers, talking in undertones by
the window, caught broken fragments of the
conversation. When Patricia Maxwell replaced
the receiver and faced them again,
her self-assurance seemed somewhat shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I . . . I guess I don&rsquo;t rightly understand,&rdquo;
she answered in a puzzled tone.
&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s been in and ransacked my boudoir.
The butler says a man, claiming to
come from the electric-light company, called
this afternoon to look at the wall-plugs or
something. Barton&mdash;that&rsquo;s the butler&mdash;left
him alone in the dining-room, which is separated
from the boudoir only by a curtain,
while he went to the back hall to answer the
telephone. He was at the instrument for two
or three minutes, he says, and when he returned
he found the boudoir window open,
the place upside down, and the man gone.
Say, who is this clubfooted man, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>But, before Desmond could answer, a
sharp &ldquo;pss-t&rdquo; from Francis called him over
to the window. Kneeling at the sill, his
brother was peering through the blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re watching the house,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Did you notice if you were followed
when you came here, Patricia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drove in a taxi,&rdquo; the girl answered,
&ldquo;so I can&rsquo;t really say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the street a young
man was pacing nonchalantly up and down,
his face raised to the houses across the way.
Even as they watched, they saw him lift his
hand. Something white fluttered . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; said Desmond, and
hurried into the adjoining bedroom.</p>
<p>The block of flats, of which he occupied
the top floor, stood at the corner of a turning
and the windows of the bedroom gave on the
side street. Before the shop occupying the
opposite corner a man was lounging. For
an instant the light from the shop front fell
on his face, a pale narrow face with a long
white scar running horizontally beneath the
right eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heinrich&rsquo;s at the corner!&rdquo; announced
Desmond, returning to the living-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clubfoot&rsquo;s aide, do you mean?&rdquo; queried
Francis.</p>
<p>Desmond nodded. &ldquo;Which his other
name is Kriege. Since he made that lucky
get-away with Grundt in the affair of the
purple cabriolet we have been looking up his
record. He is said to be a first-class linguist
and a marvellous hand at disguises. I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he were not Miss Maxwell&rsquo;s
friend, Saumergue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it bore you frightfully to stay
and dine with us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But I thought
you two boys were coming home with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be out of the question to leave the
house for the present&mdash;at any rate, by the
front door,&rdquo; said Desmond, and picked up
the telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to Mr. Krilenko,&rdquo; he
said when he got the number he had asked
for. &ldquo;Is that you, Professor? Desmond
Okewood speaking. I want you to come
round here at once. You can&rsquo;t? You&rsquo;re in
bed with lumbago? Damn! Well, I&rsquo;ll just
have to come to you, that&rsquo;s all. Yes, I&rsquo;ll
be along in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be the overhead route,&rdquo; he
said to his brother as he replaced the receiver.</p>
<p>Francis looked anxiously at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call up the Chief,&rdquo; he said in an undertone,
&ldquo;and get help. You&rsquo;re so devilish reckless,
Des. What are you up to now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Miss Maxwell will lend me her holy
picture for an hour or so,&rdquo; his brother retorted,
smiling graciously at the American,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a few inquiries. No
need to worry the Chief&mdash;at least, not yet.
Bolt the front door, will you, old boy? And
if I were you I shouldn&rsquo;t answer the bell
while I&rsquo;m away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The little lobby between Desmond Okewood&rsquo;s
bedroom and the bathroom was surmounted
by a skylight to which a ladder
gave access. When not in use the ladder was
hoisted out of reach by means of a rope and
pulley. Having buttoned the ikon beneath
his waistcoat, Desmond lowered the ladder
and mounted to the skylight. With a wave
of his hand to Francis and Patricia looking
up at him from below, he pushed up the skylight
and scrambled through, pulling the
ladder up after him; they heard the glazed
trap slam and he was gone.</p>
<p>With the sure gait of one who treads a
familiar path, Desmond made his way across
the black leads, a mere shadow dimly seen
between the soot-encrusted chimney-pots.
The wind blew keen and lusty across the
roofs, rattling a loose trap here and there
and merrily spinning the chimney-cowls.
Above the prowler&rsquo;s head the sky glowed
redly with the reflection of the London
lights.</p>
<p>Desmond descended a rusty iron fire-ladder,
clambered over a chimney buttress,
scaled a railing, and at length halted in front
of a low grey door. His hand glided along
the stone cornice below until it came upon
what he was seeking. Within the house a
bell trilled faintly twice, then thrice. Then
the door opened. A grey-haired woman,
shielding against the draught a candle in
her hands, stood on the narrow stair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re quite a
stranger, sir! It must be fully three years
since you last used the overhead route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond grinned. &ldquo;I thought I was out
of the profession, Mother Howe,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but, dash it, I&rsquo;m beginning to think they&rsquo;ve
brought me back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a little something, Major?&rdquo;
said the woman, backing down the
stairs, &ldquo;just for old times&rsquo; sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; Desmond answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in the deuce of a hurry, Mother Howe, and
that&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes later he stood in Saint
James&rsquo;s Street, waiting at the kerb for the
taxi he had summoned from the rank. Sixty
yards farther along two dim figures still kept
their silent watch beneath the lighted windows
of Desmond Okewood&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p class="tb">Six o&rsquo;clock was ringing out from the
clock-tower of Saint James&rsquo;s Palace, that
authentic witness of the pageantry of four
centuries of English history, when Desmond
Okewood crept away across the roofs.
Francis and Patricia returned to the sitting-room.
Francis suggested double-dummy
bridge to pass the time of waiting. But
Patricia shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about poor little S&uuml;sslein,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I wonder why he committed
suicide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the first that Clubfoot has
frightened into destroying himself!&rdquo; said
Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? What had S&uuml;sslein done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I imagine he was
ordered to get the ikon out of you and he
simply couldn&rsquo;t face the consequences of his
failure. Old Clubfoot has a devilish long
arm, Patricia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about this man Clubfoot,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>So Francis gave her, as far as he knew it,
the history of the man of power and mystery
who, in the heyday of the Hohenzollerns,
had wielded an influence second only to that
of his Imperial master. He drew for her a
picture of the man, ruthless, resourceful,
vigilant, with the strength of an ox, the
courage of a lion, and the cunning of a rogue
elephant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he wants a thing,&rdquo; said Francis, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll
stop at nothing to get it. There&rsquo;s only one
man who has ever got the better of him, and
that&rsquo;s my brother Des. He&rsquo;s a crazy devil,
that brother of mine. He simply can&rsquo;t live
without taking risks. Ever since he left
the Secret Service he&rsquo;s been perfectly miserable.
The reappearance of Clubfoot has
made another man of him. But I&rsquo;m haunted
by the fear that Clubfoot will get him one
day. That&rsquo;s what makes me so anxious
when he goes off suddenly like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia smiled rather incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hear you boys talk,&rdquo; she remarked,
glancing down at her pinky polished nails,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d think we were living in Ruritania
or one of those exciting places in Booth
Tarkington Land. I admit I was a bit taken
aback to find that some one had rifled my
boudoir; it may have been your clubfoot
man, or it may just have been a common
sneak-thief. But, for land&rsquo;s sakes, what can
happen to your brother in a city like London?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The telephone pealed suddenly. The bell
jangled noisily through the silent flat. The
man and the girl exchanged a glance. There
are moments when the sudden clamour of a
telephone bell has an oddly frightening effect.
Francis went to the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! No, he&rsquo;s not here. Who wants
him? Oh . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner became slightly more <i>empress&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Francis Okewood speaking.
Very good. Tell the Chief I&rsquo;ll come right
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang off and turned to Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an urgent call from the office,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll have to go along at
once. It&rsquo;s a quarter to eight. Des. must
be back any minute now. Do you mind being
left alone for a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! You run right along
and don&rsquo;t mind about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not frightened . . . or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Frightened . . . nothing!&rdquo; retorted Miss
Maxwell with considerable emphasis. &ldquo;Say,
if that old dot-and-carry-one shows up, I&rsquo;ll
vamp him so hard he&rsquo;ll just beat it back to
Deutschland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis laughed. &ldquo;Good for you. If you
want anything, just ring for Batts, will you?
I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can. Bye-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The front door slammed.</p>
<p>As if struck by a sudden idea, Patricia
went to the window and peered beneath the
blind. The watcher still lounged on the opposite
pavement. She observed him for a
full two minutes. Then she saw him turn
suddenly and walk swiftly down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for Francis!&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>
<p>She took up the cards and began to play
Canfield. But she could not keep her mind
on the game; her thoughts were busy with
the strange and sinister figure who, that
very morning, had loomed so large in her
dainty drawing-room. She threw down the
cards and went to the telephone. She would
ring up the house and tell Barton she was
dining out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>But now she could get no answer from the
exchange. The line remained completely
dead. She depressed the hook repeatedly
without any result. At last she hung up
the receiver, and going to the fire-place,
pressed the bell-push in the wall beside it.
Then she went back to the telephone.</p>
<p>No sound of life came to her over the
wires. The line must be out of order, she
thought. But then she remembered that
Francis Okewood had used the instrument
only a few minutes before. And no one
came in response to her ring. A little feeling
of fear crept over her like a trickle of ice-water
running down her back. Why were
both telephone and bell out of order?</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard the sitting-room door
behind her open. Ah! the valet at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rang,&rdquo; she said, speaking over her
shoulder, at the same time depressing the
hook of the telephone instrument, &ldquo;to ask
you what is the matter with the telephone. I
can&rsquo;t get a reply from the . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence in the room made her turn.</p>
<p>At the table Dr. Madjaroff, her visitor of
the morning, stood looking at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SECRET OF THE IKON</span></h2>
<p>She must have dropped the telephone receiver,
for a clatter sounded dully
in her ears. The strange and baleful glare
of the man at the table held her gaze. The
blood seemed to drain away from her heart
as she met the cruel menace of those blackly
bitter eyes. The bushy dark beard had vanished
and the fleshy scarlet lips pressed
together in a hard line were clearly visible
above the squarely massive chin. But
she knew her visitor again immediately. It
was as though she recognized the extraordinary
air of authority that his presence exhaled
without requiring the additional aid to
identification that the heavy misshapen boot
presented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>She felt as though she must scream. The
mute telephone, the unanswered bell, the sudden
appearance of this frightening, apelike
creature in the room, above all, his forbidding,
ominous silence, produced a culminating
effect of terror upon her. And, though
she wilted before the fixed stare of those
burning eyes beneath the bristling black eyebrows,
she could not look away.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came an interruption.
Two men emerged from the bedroom door
and took up their position behind the
stranger. One was a narrow-chested youth
whose pointed nose and snarling mouth had
something of the rodent about them, his sallow
cheek slashed by a long white scar. The
other was a gross and burly fellow with a
bullet neck, close-cropped hair, and small pig
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Niemand da?&rdquo; asked the clubfooted
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kein Mensch, Herr Doktor!&rdquo; replied the
youth with the scarred face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The voices broke the spell that had seemed
to bind her. Her eager American vitality
came to her aid. She began to study with
interest this man of whom Francis Okewood
had told her. &ldquo;Strong as an ox, brave as a
lion, cunning as a rogue elephant,&rdquo; he had
called him. And cautious as a cat, she told
herself as she watched him peering about
the room with quick, suspicious glances, his
gaze always returning to the door as though
he feared interruption.</p>
<p>He gave a curt order in German to the
men behind him, then removed his black
wide-awake hat, displaying a glistening mass
of iron-grey stubble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Maxwell,&rdquo; he said with a fawning
civility that struck chill upon her, &ldquo;I have
come to fetch the ikon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he spoke in English, harshly,
with a thick guttural accent.</p>
<p>She clasped her hands tightly together.
They were as cold as ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have not got it,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>A deep furrow appeared between the
cripple&rsquo;s bushy eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advise you not to play with me,&rdquo; he
said. He took a step forward. The thud of
his heavy boot shook the floor. &ldquo;Where is
it?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I . . . I left it . . . at home!&rdquo; stammered
the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>His great arm shot out. A huge hairy
paw, hot and soft, clamped itself with a vice-like
grip about her wrist. Of a sudden his
face was distorted with fury, so that his
heavy sallow cheeks trembled beneath their
thatch of loose black hairs. He might have
been a huge man-ape chattering with passion
as he shook her in that iron grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie! You lie!&rdquo; he spat at her. &ldquo;You
brought it here to the spy, Okewood. That
ikon is here, you understand me? Donnerwetter,
are you going to give it up?&rdquo; With
a supreme effort he regained his self-control.
But he did not relax his grasp on her hand.
&ldquo;If you refuse, I have the means to make
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Doktor,&rdquo; said a suave voice from
the other side of the room, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you let
go Miss Maxwell&rsquo;s wrist? I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re
hurting her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a roar Clubfoot swung round. A
large automatic was in his hand. His two
companions had likewise drawn and covered
Desmond Okewood, who, dapper and unruffled
as ever, his hat on the back of his
head, stood in the bedroom door, a brown
paper parcel under his arm.
Clubfoot laughed, a harsh and grating
laugh. &ldquo;Put your hands up, my friend!&rdquo; he
said menacingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Desmond wavered. &ldquo;But I shall drop my
little parcel . . .&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em up, zum Teufel nochmal!&rdquo;
roared the cripple, his tufted nostrils twitching
with rage.</p>
<p>Desmond hesitated for an instant. He
shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss Maxwell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
only Francis had been here . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, pitching his parcel on the table, he
slowly raised his hands above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him covered, Jungens!&rdquo; cried Clubfoot
and flung himself upon the parcel.
&ldquo;Francis, indeed!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He had
an important telephone summons just now,
didn&rsquo;t he, Miss Maxwell?&rdquo; And he chuckled
noisily.</p>
<p>But the American did not heed him. With
a pink flush on her cheeks she was staring
fixedly at Desmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The young man sought to avoid her gaze.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s three to one,&rdquo; he muttered, abashed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea they&rsquo;d be able to get in here!
I should never have brought it back if I&rsquo;d
dreamed of . . . this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now, with a shout of joy, Clubfoot had
drawn from its paper wrapping the ikon with
its blackened silver sheath. With a rapid
motion he thrust the little picture into the
capacious pocket of his overcoat. Then he
turned to Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieber junger Herr&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke in German
now&mdash;&ldquo;if on this occasion I should neglect
to settle the debt which has for so long
been outstanding between us, believe me it is
because other considerations take precedence.
Do not delude yourself, however!
When I want you, I have only to stretch out
my hand&rdquo;&mdash;he raised his long prehensile arm
with clutching fingers&mdash;&ldquo;and crush you like
an egg! Heinrich, Max, vorw&auml;rts! Miss
Maxwell! Ich habe die Ehre!&rdquo; He broke
into English. &ldquo;It would have been wiser to
have accepted my offer of this morning, or,
better still, from this poor S&uuml;sslein&rsquo;s point
of view, to have listened to reason last
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed to the American and, with head
erect, stumped out into the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Hardly had the door closed upon him than
Patricia Maxwell turned on Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You . . . you quitter!&rdquo; she exclaimed
with withering contempt in her voice.
&ldquo;Are you going to let him beat you to it all
along the line? Are there no <i>men</i> in this
town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Desmond held up his hand. He had
altogether discarded his rather abashed air.
Now his eyes sparkled and a little smile
played about his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me five minutes&rsquo; grace,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll explain everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to explain!&rdquo; cried Patricia
hotly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got my ikon, hasn&rsquo;t he?
What&rsquo;s there to explain about that, I&rsquo;d like
to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Desmond Okewood had dashed out
into the hall. She heard him rattling loudly
at the front door. In a moment he was back
in the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve wedged up the front door!&rdquo; he
cried and snatched the telephone receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wire&rsquo;s cut!&rdquo; said Patricia coldly.
&ldquo;And your man doesn&rsquo;t answer the bell!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man.
&ldquo;I might have known he&rsquo;d come here after
you! And there&rsquo;s no time to get out by the
roof! To think that he&rsquo;s walking calmly
down Saint James&rsquo;s Street . . .!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he tore out into the hall. The little
flat rang to the din of his frantic assault on
the front door. Presently the noise ceased.
She heard the voice of Francis outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . Decoyed me away with a
bogus message from the Chief,&rdquo; he was saying,
&ldquo;and Batts is imprisoned in the lift with
the cable cut. What&rsquo;s happened to Patricia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Desmond rushed downstairs like
a madman. What&rsquo;s happened, Patricia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She surveyed him coldly. &ldquo;Nothing, only
your clubfooted friend came here to fetch
the ikon . . . my ikon. And your
brother had the . . . the presence of
mind to give it to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desmond gave it to him?&rdquo; Francis Okewood
seemed dazed.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Desmond Okewood reappeared, panting.
Without speaking he crossed the sitting-room
and went into the bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see it with my own eyes?&rdquo; said
the girl impatiently. &ldquo;Without the least
show of fight!&rdquo; she added contemptuously.
She gathered her furs around her. &ldquo;Do you
think I could get a taxi?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>But Francis was staring past her.
&ldquo;Des.!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such unbounded amazement in
his exclamation that, involuntarily, the girl
turned round. Desmond Okewood stood behind
them. And on the table before him lay
the ikon. In the doorway of the bedroom
appeared a little yellow-faced man muffled
up to the eyes in an ulster and scarf.</p>
<p>Desmond&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Let me introduce
Professor Krilenko, the celebrated Russian
art connoisseur,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Although
he is crippled with lumbago he came roof-climbing
with me to-night to help me get the
better of old Clubfoot. There&rsquo;s friendship
for you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The Professor bowed and groaned piteously,
snatching at his back. &ldquo;What a
man!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Patricia Maxwell stared in silence at the
pair. But her eyes were softer.</p>
<p>Desmond turned to the Professor. &ldquo;Tell
them about it!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Krilenko picked up the ikon. &ldquo;Fate has
placed in your hands, Madame,&rdquo; he said in
fluent English, &ldquo;one of the most revered
treasures of the Russian Church, none other
than the miraculous ikon of Our Lady of
Smolensk, smuggled out of Russia at the
time of the Bolshevik Revolution to save it
from desecration at the hands of the Reds.
It is probably a thousand years old, but the
tradition is that it was painted by the
evangelist Luke himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Okewood, who knows this man
Grundt, doubted whether religious or artistic
fervour had anything to do with his determination
to acquire the ikon. With a perspicacity
which I can only ascribe as astounding,
he insisted that there was something
about the picture which enhanced its artistic
or intrinsic value . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>So saying he turned the ikon over on its
face. Four screws loosely set held the stout
wooden backing of the frame. He removed
the screws and lifted out the back. In four
slots sunk in the wood four little grey metal
tubes were visible. Round one of them a
slip of paper was wrapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He suggested that we should remove the
back,&rdquo; the Professor resumed, &ldquo;if we could
do so without damaging the ikon. We
scraped the back and at length laid bare the
screws. Their presence had been very skilfully
concealed first beneath a layer
of . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Russian was evidently, like most experts,
a prosy person, but imperiously Patricia
stopped him before he could launch
out into technicalities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those little bits of lead?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radium!&rdquo; Desmond replied. &ldquo;Translate
the letter, Krilenko!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>He detached the slip of paper that was
rolled about one of the cases and handed it to
the Professor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, Vladimir Lemuroff [Krilenko read out],
Professor of Chemistry in the University of
Moscow, being in imminent danger of arrest by
the Tcheka [&ldquo;the Extraordinary Commission of
the Soviet Government,&rdquo; Krilenko explained],
have in the presence of Bishop Tchergeroff,
whose signature is here appended, concealed for
safe custody in the blessed ikon of Our Lady of
Smolensk the four grammes of radium, the property
of the Moscow Chemical Institute, which I
took with me in my flight to save them for science
from the ruthless vandalism of the wild beasts
who are destroying Holy Russia.</p>
<p><span class="jr">(Signed) <span class="sc">Lemuroff</span></span>
<span class="jr">(Witness) <span class="sc">Tchergeroff</span></span></p>
<p>Smolensk, 13/26, July, 1919</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; ejaculated Francis. &ldquo;Four
grammes of radium! Let&rsquo;s see!&mdash;the market
price stands somewhere about &pound;12,000
a gramme, I think. That makes these four
little tubes worth something like &pound;50,000.
No wonder old Clubfoot wanted that picture,
Des.!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; remarked Patricia, perplexed, &ldquo;I
<i>saw</i> you give the ikon to the man Grundt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Desmond laughed. &ldquo;I had to finesse him,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Old Clubfoot never lets the grass
grow under his feet, and I wanted to gain
time to get your ikon into a safe place before
he could seize it by force. Directly I found
out from Krilenko here that this was one of
the famous miraculous ikons, I knew, from
my experience of Russia, that thousands of
copies must be in existence, for most of the
ikons you find in Russian churches and
homes are copies of these wonder-working
pictures. Krilenko, who has been a perfect
trump all through, routed up a Russian pope
he knows who remembered that there was a
copy of the Madonna of Smolensk in one of
the Russian churches in London. It was
nice and grimy, as it had hung there for
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Krilenko and the priest did the rest. My
intention was to hang up the copy in your
boudoir for Clubfoot to steal, for I was
virtually certain that your house would be
broken into to-night. But, when we were
scrambling over the roofs just now, I heard
old Grundt&rsquo;s voice coming up through the
skylight and I just couldn&rsquo;t resist the chance
of bluffing him. My word, I could hardly
keep my face straight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced humorously at Patricia. She
held out her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel just terribly!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry I was so rude! But, oh! what an
actor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond grinned. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t bad, was
it? Especially the pathetic bit about their
being three to one . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the mean time Grundt is off again!&rdquo;
observed Francis ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clever devil!&rdquo; said Desmond with
real admiration in his voice. &ldquo;He simply
bunged up the front door and walked out,
knowing that one minute&rsquo;s grace would be
enough to allow him, lame as he is, to get
away in the London crowd. Directly you
opened the door I bolted down to the street.
But I knew it was too late. We&rsquo;ve just got
to wait for him to come back . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have shot you!&rdquo; remarked
Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he! Clubfoot knows that you can
commit almost any crime in London as long
as you act normally. But a shot would have
aroused the whole block. Besides, he&rsquo;s a
single-minded person. To-day he was after
the ikon. Next time it may be you or me.
I don&rsquo;t worry about losing his trail, Francis.
He&rsquo;s coming back after us . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>He chuckled with infinite relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Des.,&rdquo; said his brother, &ldquo;tell us the
joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Desmond replied slowly, &ldquo;when
we were weighting that duplicate ikon, I
couldn&rsquo;t resist slipping in a note for Clubfoot.
I was just thinking of his face when
he reads it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he chuckled again.</p>
<p class="tb">By Patricia Maxwell&rsquo;s direction the
radium, duly tested and found to be genuine,
was handed over to the Russian Refugees&rsquo;
Fund. The ikon of Our Lady of Smolensk
went to take the place of the copy in the Russian
church, where, night and day, a great
candle burns before it in memory of the
donor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>As for Clubfoot, the evening traffic of
Saint James&rsquo;s swallowed up him and his companions,
and the unremitting vigilance of the
Secret Service, assisted by Scotland Yard,
threw no light on their whereabouts. But,
two days after the encounter in his flat, Desmond
Okewood found in his mail a postcard,
unsigned, with this epigrammatic message:</p>
<p class="center"><i>A sense of humour is a dangerous thing!</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE UNSEEN MENACE</span></h2>
<p>It was about the time of the adventure
of the top flat which I am going to narrate
that I became aware of a remarkable
change in my friend, Desmond Okewood.
We were in the habit of meeting once or
twice a week either for lunch or for a game
of squash at the Bath Club. Now, Desmond
Okewood, as his Christian name suggests,
is, on the distaff side, Irish, and from his
mother&rsquo;s race he has inherited not only the
intuition and reckless courage which have
carried him so far in his career, but also
that sublime indifference to anything like
&ldquo;nerves&rdquo; that is one of the outstanding
characteristics of the Irish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>It was, therefore, with considerable surprise
that, about this time, I became aware
that my old friend was looking decidedly
under par. His face had a drawn look that I
did not like, and his eyes were haggard. I
should probably have set it down to a succession
of late nights had not old Erasmus
Wilkes, the psychoanalyst, who was lunching
at our table at the Club one morning, drawn
me aside in the smoke-room afterwards and
put the matter in an entirely different light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a friend of Desmond Okewood&rsquo;s,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked me, and went on:
&ldquo;Then get him to tell you what&rsquo;s on his
mind. I&rsquo;m not pryin&rsquo;, young fellow, but I
have some experience of these cases. If your
pal doesn&rsquo;t confide in some one . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and was about
to turn away when I caught him by the sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re old friends, Desmond and I,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;but there are some confidences one
has to wait for. And Okewood&rsquo;s a reserved
beggar. It might help things, Doctor, if
you&rsquo;d give me a hint as to what is the matter,
with him. He&rsquo;ll never say a word unless I
give him a lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Wilkes looked at me thoughtfully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fear,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>I burst out laughing. &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a bloomer there, Doctor.
Fear! Why, Desmond Okewood doesn&rsquo;t
know the meaning of the word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilkes shook his head dubiously. &ldquo;He
looks like a man who goes in fear of his life,&rdquo;
he answered gravely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the wind up
about something. You ask him and you&rsquo;ll
see that I&rsquo;m right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him like a shot,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;but
I bet you&rsquo;re wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, in due course, I did ask Desmond
Okewood. But he, as I expected, laughed
my question off and protested that he had
never felt better in his life. But old Wilkes
was right, and it was Francis Okewood, as
he afterwards told me, in whom Desmond
ultimately confided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>It happened in this way. Francis had had
to make a quick trip to America on business
connected with some property of his American
wife, and Desmond had gone down in his
car to meet his brother at Southampton.
Storms in the Atlantic had delayed the arrival
of the liner, and after they had cleared
the baggage through the customs, it was
close on midnight before they took the road
to drive to Desmond&rsquo;s bungalow in Surrey.
Yet, belated as they were, Francis was quite
unable to prevail upon his brother to exceed
a modest twenty miles an hour, which, as
they dropped down a deep slope into the
sunken road that led past the front gate of
Desmond&rsquo;s bungalow, fell to somewhere
about ten.</p>
<p>Before them the road, like a profound
black trench, wound its way down into the
dark night. The bright headlights of the
car showed the high hedges on either side
and, above them, the tall trees that bordered
the road swaying and tossing with the violence
of the storm. The driving-glass was a
blur of wet; the side curtains flapped and
banged and strained to the fury of the gale,
and again and again a smother of icy rain
beat on the face of Desmond at the wheel and
of his brother at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push her along, Des., for the love o&rsquo;
Mike!&rdquo; urged Francis for about the sixth
time that night. &ldquo;This is worse than the
Atlantic. And I want to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awkward bit of road, this,&rdquo; was Desmond&rsquo;s
answer as, heedless of his brother&rsquo;s
remarks, he changed down to second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, good Lord, what are you going to
meet at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning? Open
her up and let&rsquo;s get home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t far to go now,&rdquo; Desmond
replied shortly, and so, without further
speech, they came at length to their destination.</p>
<p>At the front door Desmond handed his
brother the latchkey and took the car round
to the back of the house. Francis crossed
the wide hall and went into the dining-room,
where a pleasant fire glowed redly on the
silver and crockery that decked the table.</p>
<p>Without waiting to remove his heavy
ulster, Francis Okewood switched on the
lights and, going to the sideboard, mixed
two stiff whiskey-and-sodas. He still had
his hand on the siphon when there came an
exclamation from the door, and the room
was plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here . . .&rdquo; he began in expostulation.
There was a click at the window, followed
by a grinding noise. Then the lights
went up again.</p>
<p>Desmond, a curiously tense expression on
his face, stood in the doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, old man,&rdquo; he said awkwardly. &ldquo;I
noticed that the shutter wasn&rsquo;t closed.
We . . . we don&rsquo;t turn the lights up here
as a rule unless the shutter is down . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis Okewood turned his eyes to the
French window, which, as he knew, opened
on the croquet lawn at the back. It was
now concealed by a close-fitting steel shutter
that reached to the floor. He raised his
eyebrows and looked at his brother as though
about to speak. But there was close communion
between these two. In all the years
they had spent together in the Secret Service
their one invariable rule was that if no explanation
were vouchsafed, none was asked
for. So Francis held his peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be starved,&rdquo; said Desmond.
&ldquo;Sit down and have some supper. You&rsquo;ve
got a drink? Good. There&rsquo;s a hot-pot
here . . .&rdquo; and he struck an electric plug
in the wall, connected with a chafing-dish on
the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>They ate in silence. The sympathy between
the two brothers was not of the kind
that requires expression in words. When
they had done, Desmond pushed a box of
cigars over to Francis and made up the fire.
Then only Francis spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Clubfoot?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Desmond, his feet stretched out on the
fender, appeared to study the end of his
cigar. Scrutinizing his features between his
half-closed eyes, Francis noticed for the first
time how worn his brother looked. The lines
on his face and an air of restlessness, most
unusual in him, were unfailing symptoms
of prolonged strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanished into the Ewigkeit. Since the
affair of the Russian ikon he has not been
seen. The Chief thinks he has left the
country. In fact, two days ago the old man
went off to Holland on a clue . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went in person, eh? It must be a good
one . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond shook his head wearily. &ldquo;Clubfoot&rsquo;s
still here, I think,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
lying low, that&rsquo;s all. Waiting . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;To get you, me, the Chief . . .&rdquo; He
shrugged his shoulders, drew on his cigar.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never quit while breath is in him,
Francis. We beat him in Germany, brought
him to the ground, the man of might and
mystery, as they used to call him. When he
reappeared so mysteriously in the Pacific, I
spoilt his little game, and since he started
this campaign of vengeance against us, we
have pretty well held our own. But though
we have the honours he means to win the
rubber. Let him try . . .&rdquo; He sprang
to his feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this cursed uncertainty that
. . . that wears one down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Des.,&rdquo; said Francis gently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to break the rules and ask you
a question. Why did you bring us up from
Southampton to-night like an old woman
driving a governess cart? That six-cylinder
of yours used to do better than
twenty . . .!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond frowned moodily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m . . .
I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
windy, Francis&mdash;have been ever since they
put a steel cable across the sunken road outside
the gate here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Francis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;That bus of mine will touch sixty when
I open her out. By the mercy of God on
this particular evening, a black night like this
with no moon, I had slowed down to tighten
up the wind-screen. The glass suddenly
shattered, but I had time to duck. There
was a steel rope spanned at the height of my
head from hedge to hedge . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Any clue as to who put it there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a trace. The Chief was wild when
I told him. But it gave me the jumps. I
stopped Marjorie driving her two-seater and
sent her off with the boy to her father&rsquo;s.
She didn&rsquo;t want to go, poor girl, but, by
George, I couldn&rsquo;t stand the strain of looking
after her as well as myself. And I know
that if this doesn&rsquo;t finish quickly, she&rsquo;ll come
back. You know what a loyal pal she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis nodded. &ldquo;And that contraption
of yours at the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond heaved himself out of his chair.
&ldquo;Come here. I want to show you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way across to the sideboard
which stood against the wall opposite the
shuttered window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Six nights ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was mixing
myself a drink here just as you did to-night.
Suddenly there was a shiver of glass from
the window behind me, and something struck
the woodwork not an inch from my head.
After that I had steel shutters fitted to all
the windows. Look! You can see the slug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Projecting from the polished oak of the
Jacobean buffet was a grey, irregular mass
of metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air-gun, eh?&rdquo; commented Francis. &ldquo;And
a devilish heavy one, too, Des.!&rdquo; He clapped
his brother affectionately on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;there are two of us
now. I shall have to try what trailing my
coat-tails in front of old Clubfoot will
do . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only consoling thing about it,&rdquo; said
his brother, &ldquo;is that it shows that old Clubfoot
is afraid to come out in the open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis rubbed the bridge of his nose
meditatively. &ldquo;I wonder! He may be planning
something fresh and wants to get you
out of the way. Has any attempt been made
on the Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis Okewood shook his head. &ldquo;Bad,
bad! Clubfoot has got him out of the
country, Des., and he&rsquo;ll strike at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had not long to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TOP FLAT</span></h2>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock, not many hours after
they had gone to bed, Desmond appeared
in his brother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to get dressed at once,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re off to London!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; protested Francis, rubbing
sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the confidential typists at the Air
Ministry has been murdered . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what . . . why . . .?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about it except that Alec
Bannington, the Chief of the Air Staff, has
been on to me on the telephone in the most
fearful state. I promised to go up and see
him at once. You&rsquo;re coming, too. Don&rsquo;t
stop to bathe or shave, but come!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>There was no twenty miles an hour about
Desmond Okewood&rsquo;s driving that morning.
The rain had stopped, the wind had dried
the sandy Surrey roads, and well within the
hour they had reached Onslow Square, where
the private house of Air-Marshal Sir Alexander
Bannington was situated.</p>
<p>He received them in a small book-lined
room on the ground floor, a florid, well-fed
dapper man, whose shining, good-natured
face was ill-suited to the look of care it now
wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Okewood!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Thank God,
you&rsquo;re here. This your brother? How de
do, how de do?&rdquo; Then he clasped his red
hands together in a gesture of anguish,
which at another time would have been grotesque.
&ldquo;The most shockin&rsquo; affair! Miss
Bardale, my confidential typist, was found
dead&mdash;murdered&mdash;in her flat this morning.
It&rsquo;s a ghastly business, ghastly, and, what is
more, unless you can do something it means
ruin for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind telling us the
whole story from the beginning, sir,&rdquo; said
Desmond. &ldquo;It would help,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if
you would omit nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis cocked a shrewdly admiring eye at
his brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The large man sighed heavily. &ldquo;I see you
have already grasped that it is a confidential
matter,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A State secret of the
utmost importance is, in fact, at stake. As
Chief of the Air Staff it has recently been my
duty to draw up for submission to the Cabinet
a comprehensive scheme for the aerial
defence of the Empire. For this purpose
I have attended many meetings with the
First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial
General Staff, as well as more than one sitting
of the Cabinet. Upon the notes I made
on these discussions I based my report. I
finished it in the rough yesterday afternoon
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gave it to your typist to make a fair
copy? Is that it?&rdquo; Desmond interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave it to her at the Ministry at six
o&rsquo;clock yesterday evening. She was to take
it home, type it out after dinner, and let me
have it back this morning. You will say,
gentlemen, that I was criminally careless in
thus letting a vitally important document
out of the office. But I thought . . . I
never imagined . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be better, sir,&rdquo; Desmond remarked
soothingly, &ldquo;if we got at the facts
first . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so,&rdquo; agreed Bannington.
&ldquo;Well, first thing this morning the resident
clerk at the Ministry rang me up to say he
had heard from the police that Miss Bardale
had been murdered and her flat ransacked
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond nodded. Then he asked: &ldquo;How
was the murder discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Miss Bardale&rsquo;s daily servant when she
arrived at the apartment about half-past six
this morning. Miss Bardale occupies a small
flat consisting of a sitting-room, bedroom,
bathroom, and kitchen on the top floor of a
house in Crewdwell Street, off Baker Street.
It appears that last night she went out to
dinner with a young man, a certain Captain
Reginald Hollingway, who brought her back
to the flat shortly after eight o&rsquo;clock. When
Miss Bardale&rsquo;s servant, a certain Mrs.
Crump, entered the flat this morning, she
found Miss Bardale lying dead in the sitting-room
and all the rooms in the wildest confusion . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;How had she been killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangled. There are deep finger-marks
on her throat. There had obviously been a
desperate struggle, for the carpet is disarranged,
the remains of a vase lie scattered
about the floor, and a clock had been knocked
off the table. This clock, by the way, furnishes
an important clue, for it had stopped
at sixteen minutes past eight, showing at
what time the murder was committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your report, you say, is not to be
found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bannington shook his head dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what the police tell me, Miss Bardale
was actually engaged in typing it out
when she was attacked. The body was discovered
lying beside her typewriter in the
sitting-room. She had apparently reached
the third page, for a sheet of paper bearing
that number&mdash;just that and nothing else&mdash;was
still in the typewriter. But the rest was
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&rdquo;&mdash;Francis Okewood spoke for
the first time&mdash;&ldquo;that the assassin simply
snatched your manuscript and as much of it
as Miss Bardale had copied out from where
it lay beside the typewriter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, yes!&rdquo; sighed the large man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why was the flat ransacked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Desmond&rsquo;s turn to glance his appreciation
at his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; the Air Marshal exclaimed,
&ldquo;I never thought of that. Then Hollingway
must have made hay in the rooms just to
mislead us . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollingway?&rdquo; ejaculated the two brothers
simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming to him. Captain Hollingway,
gentlemen, is undoubtedly the murderer.
He is a young man of good family with an
excellent war record, but since demobilization
has done no work. He is an exhibition
dancer at night-clubs, and is in grave money
difficulties, so the police inform me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he under arrest?&rdquo; asked Desmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Bannington nodded. &ldquo;The porter at
Crewdwell Street saw him leave the building
in a state of profound agitation about twenty-five
minutes past eight or shortly after the
murder was committed. The police arrested
him at his rooms this morning. The report,
of course, had disappeared. With a clear
start of twelve hours he had naturally passed
it on. Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a despairing exclamation the fat man
dashed his fist into the palm of his hand and
began to pace the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some party, then, who had an
interest in obtaining possession of this report?&rdquo;
asked Desmond.</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Bannington stopped in his
stride and turned round. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But in the present state of international
politics it is hardly safe even to mention the
name of the Power in question.&rdquo; He leant
forward and whispered something in Desmond&rsquo;s
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! . . . yes!&rdquo; was that young man&rsquo;s
brief comment.</p>
<p>The large man extended two shaking hands
towards his visitors. &ldquo;You must get this
report back for me. If it&rsquo;s a question of
money you can draw on me up to any reasonable
amount. Hollingway must be made to
talk. The police will give you every facility:
I have arranged that. I shall be here all day.
I am not going to the Ministry. I can&rsquo;t
face them. Let me know to-day . . .
soon . . . how you get on . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Desmond and his brother had risen to their
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question before we leave you, sir,&rdquo;
said Desmond. &ldquo;Are you quite satisfied that
Miss Bardale was trustworthy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enid Bardale,&rdquo; the Air Marshal replied
in a voice that shook with emotion, &ldquo;gave
her life for her trust. She was a splendid
girl and absolutely invaluable to me in my
work. I trusted her as I would trust my own
daughter. As a matter of fact, she was a
relative of my dead wife. She may have
been indiscreet in the matter of her friendship
with this scoundrel Hollingway; but
there was no question of collusion between
them in this affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left him bowed over his desk, his face
sunk in his plump, red hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p class="tb">The girl&rsquo;s body lay on its side on the black
carpet of the little sitting-room, the face an
agonized mask in a frame of clustering
brown hair. The sight was not pleasant, and
they did not let their glance dwell on it, for,
after all, their immediate business was not
with the murdered woman. They looked
long enough, however, to notice the deep
bluish-black marks on the throat, indicative
of a ferocious grip.</p>
<p>The flat, skyed at the top of a big mansion
which had been converted into apartments,
was tiny. The hall led into the small sitting-room,
very gay with its primrose-yellow distempered
walls and orange lamp-shades, with
bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen beyond.
Detective-Inspector Farandol, of Scotland
Yard, who opened the door in answer to their
ring, showed them the rooms. One of the
most reliable and experienced officers of the
older school of detectives, both Desmond and
Francis had come across him more than once
in the course of their work in the Secret
Service. He was a self-opinionated person
with a profound contempt for amateurs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourth floor,&rdquo; remarked the Inspector.
&ldquo;Nothing above and nothing below, for this
is the only flat in the building. The other
floors are let off as offices, and after 6 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>
the rest of the house is empty except for the
porter who lives in the basement. No wonder
no sounds of the struggle were heard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>That a most violent and desperate struggle
had gone forward was abundantly evident
from the state of the sitting-room, which, as
Farandol was careful to point out, was exactly
as the police had discovered it. The
black carpet was rucked up, and athwart it,
in a mess of crushed petals and broken glass,
the remains of a vase of daffodils was scattered.
A string of crystal beads which the
dead girl had been wearing had broken, and
the beads, together with a number of hairpins,
strewed the floor. The telltale clock, of
which Bannington had spoken, had been retrieved
and now stood upon the table beside
the typewriter&mdash;a small French travelling-clock
in a leather case. The glass was
broken. They noticed that, as Bannington
had said, the hands pointed at sixteen minutes
past eight.</p>
<p>Farandol tapped the clock. &ldquo;This is what
is going to hang Master Hollingway,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; commented Desmond. &ldquo;That
won&rsquo;t bring us what we&rsquo;re looking for, Inspector.
I suppose you know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farandol nodded impressively. &ldquo;Aye. But
he&rsquo;s got rid of it by now, mark my words.
He&rsquo;s one of your deep ones is Master Hollingway.
He thought he&rsquo;d draw a red herring
across the scent. Look at this room and the
bedroom beyond! He&rsquo;s even upset the flour-bins
in the kitchen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rooms were, indeed, in a state of remarkable
confusion. In the sitting-room the
sloping top of a little mahogany escritoire
had been burst open and every drawer pulled
out. The doors of the oaken buffet stood
wide, and its contents, crockery and table
linen, were in part spilled out on the carpet.
In the bedroom a high-boy had been rifled
and garments of all kinds flung about the
room. The very bed had been pulled out
from the wall, the bedclothes rolled up in a
ball and the mattress dragged on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the time,&rdquo; Farandol resumed,
&ldquo;this precious document was lying there beside
the typewriter! All this&rdquo;&mdash;he waved a
contemptuous hand at the disordered room&mdash;&ldquo;play-acting
is meant to bolster up his
story about the footstep on the back
stair . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made a statement, then?&rdquo; queried
Desmond. &ldquo;I suppose he denies everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the innocent babe all right, same
as they all are at the first go-off,&rdquo; observed
Farandol, fingering his waxed moustache.
&ldquo;Briefly, his story is that he met Miss Bardale
in Soho for dinner at a quarter to seven.
They had arranged to dine early because of
this work that the lady had to do. Hollingway
brought her back shortly after eight,
and, he says, escorted her upstairs as far as
the door of her flat because she was feeling
nervous. On the previous evening&mdash;according
to what this Hollingway says she told
him&mdash;she had heard a heavy step outside her
kitchen on the back stairs . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a minute,&rdquo; Desmond interrupted;
&ldquo;is there a back entrance? I didn&rsquo;t notice
it . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Without replying, the detective walked
through the bathroom into the kitchen and
there lifted a chintz curtain, disclosing a
door. He turned the handle and showed a
series of iron staircases leading down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a fire-escape,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;but apparently Miss Bardale used it as a
tradesman&rsquo;s entrance to the flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was chilly outside and they soon re-entered
the flat where Farandol resumed his
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollingway left her at the door of the
flat, he says. He declares he did not go in.
He remained talking to the girl for about
ten minutes at the top of the staircase outside
her flat, and then went down while she
went indoors. Webb, the porter, who is on
duty all day long in the hall below&mdash;he&rsquo;s an
old man with a game leg and can&rsquo;t get about
much&mdash;saw them come in soon after eight
and saw Hollingway leave alone about
twenty minutes later. He knows Hollingway
well, and states that he was struck by the
change in the young man&rsquo;s manner. He was
pale and upset-like and made no reply when
Webb bade him good-night. As far as the
police is concerned, Major Okewood, the case
is as clear as daylight; but it doesn&rsquo;t bring
you any nearer what you&rsquo;re after; I quite
realize that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>With an abstracted air Desmond, who was
poking about amid the confusion of the
sitting-room, nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Hollingway attempt to account for
his agitation?&rdquo; Francis said to Farandol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rather!&rdquo; The detective replied.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it all pat. Says he was in love
with the girl, has been for years, and last
night, when he again asked her to marry him,
she turned him down good and hard, told
him that a professional dancer was no good
to her as a husband and all the rest of it.
He tells it all very well,&rdquo; the Inspector
added, musingly. He picked up his hat and
gloves. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be coming along presently
to take the body to the mortuary,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving one of my men to stand by.
I shall be at the Yard all the morning if I can
be of any assistance, gentlemen . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Desmond replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably
be telephoning you, Inspector. I should
rather like to have a word with this porter
fellow, what&rsquo;s his name&mdash;ah, yes, Webb.
Send him up, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Farandol laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a proper thickhead,&rdquo;
he observed. &ldquo;That dense, you
couldn&rsquo;t hammer a tenpenny nail into his
skull without blunting it. I&rsquo;ll send him up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pompous ass!&rdquo; commented Francis as the
Inspector shut the front door behind him.</p>
<p>Then he swung round sharply. Desmond
had called to him in a tense voice. His
brother stood behind him holding a torn envelope
in his hand. He thrust it, and with
it a folded letter, at Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The envelope was addressed, in what
seemed to be a woman&rsquo;s hand, to Miss Enid
Bardale, Flat 7, 31, Crewdwell Street, W.<span class="sc">I.</span>
The letter, written from an address at Saint
John&rsquo;s Wood, and signed &ldquo;Your affectionate
Mother, M. Bardale,&rdquo; was to remind &ldquo;Dearest
E.&rdquo; that she was expected to dinner on the
following Saturday at seven-thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see . . .&rdquo; Francis began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The postmark, man, the postmark!&rdquo; cried
Desmond.</p>
<p>Francis turned to the envelope again. The
postmark was unusually clear. It read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="ST JOHN&rsquo;S WOOD NW8, 6 PM 23 MAR 1923" width="400" height="396" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s date!&rdquo; said Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found that letter in the drawer of the
typewriting table. It was posted at Saint
John&rsquo;s Wood before six o&rsquo;clock yesterday
evening,&rdquo; Desmond exclaimed emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, therefore, delivered here by the
last post. Now what time is the last delivery
in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock . . .&rdquo; began Francis.
Then broke off. &ldquo;By George, Des.,&rdquo; he said
slowly. &ldquo;I take my hat off to you. You can
give us all points. Of course, this letter
knocks the bottom out of old Farandol&rsquo;s
theory. The girl was alone in the flat, therefore
to take this letter from the postman she
must have been alive at 9 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, therefore the
murder did not take place while Hollingway
was here, that is to say, before eight-twenty.
Unless Hollingway came back . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said his brother, &ldquo;Webb, the porter,
must tell us. Here he is, I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Webb was a forlorn-looking old man with
a shining bald pate and a haggard face intersected
with blue veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Webb,&rdquo; said Desmond, advancing
to the front hall to meet him. &ldquo;I want
you to answer one or two questions. What
time did Captain Hollingway leave here last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain &rsquo;Ollingway?&rdquo; queried the old
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the gentleman that brought Miss
Bardale home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man appeared to think. &ldquo;It wor
about twenty-five minutes past h&rsquo;eight,
Mister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know the time so exactly?&rdquo;
demanded Desmond.</p>
<p>Old Webb cast him a sly look. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cos for
why from where I sets in the front &rsquo;all I kin
&rsquo;ear the clock on Saint Jude&rsquo;s strike. The
quarter &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t long gorn and the &rsquo;arf &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t
struck w&rsquo;en the Capting come out. &lsquo;Wish
you good-night, Capting,&rsquo; I sez . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you have noted the time
so carefully?&rdquo; Desmond broke in impatiently.</p>
<p>Old Webb&rsquo;s rheumy eyes puckered up as
a cunning grin slowly broke out over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a-waitin&rsquo; for my supper-beer,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;The gal brings it every night at
&rsquo;arf-past h&rsquo;eight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond smiled. &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you on duty in the hall all the
evening?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wor, sir, till midnight, w&rsquo;en I locks up,
same as allus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never left the hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Captain Hollingway come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There worn&rsquo;t nobody come the whole
dratted evenin&rsquo; arter &rsquo;im, only the pos&rsquo;man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the postman came eh? At what
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round about nine o&rsquo;clock or a bit arter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take the letters up or does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E do! I can&rsquo;t get around much along
o&rsquo; my bad leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know if there were any letters for
Miss Bardale?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno nothink about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the postman say anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E wor put out &rsquo;cos, &rsquo;e said, there wor but
the one letter and &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad to carry it to the
very top!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Miss Bardale&rsquo;s, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shot his questioner a crafty
glance. &ldquo;&rsquo;E didn&rsquo;t say nuthin&rsquo; about <i>&rsquo;er</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long was he up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not above a minute or so, Mister. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s
a spry one for the stairs, is our postman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond made a movement of impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Inspector Farandol about the
postman calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos &rsquo;e never arst me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, old boy,&rdquo; said Desmond to his
brother when, with some difficulty, they had
got rid of the ancient janitor, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s look at
the facts. We&rsquo;ve advanced things by half
an hour. Hollingway is eliminated; the postman
is eliminated, for we know that he was
in the building only for a minute or two
altogether. No one crossed the front hall
downstairs after the postman&rsquo;s departure,
and at midnight the front door was shut.
We therefore come back to our only other
indication . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;The heavy footstep that Miss Bardale
heard on the back stairs on the previous
evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. I was wondering whether that
point had struck you. We cannot assume
that the murderer was hidden in the flat
waiting for Miss Bardale&rsquo;s arrival. He evidently
followed the couple back from dinner,
for he was sufficiently acquainted with their
movements to make this rather able attempt
to fix the guilt on Hollingway. You have
seen the front staircase: there is nowhere
to hide even a cat. And the floors below are
untenanted after six o&rsquo;clock. We return,
therefore, to the back stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back doors are usually kept locked. Not
only is the back door in this flat, tenanted by
a girl living alone, open, but the key is missing.
There are no marks of violence on the
lock outside: consequently, if the murderer
entered by that way, he must have used a
key; therefore he must be familiar with his
surroundings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Bardale open in person the last
letter she was destined to receive in this life,
or did the murderer, his ghastly job accomplished,
do so? I think that Miss Bardale
opened it, for I found it placed on the top
of a neat pile of correspondence in the drawer
of her typewriting table, where she was obviously
accustomed to keep her letters.
Therefore, at nine o&rsquo;clock, or thereabouts, she
was alive. When was she murdered? I will
tell you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he lifted from the table the
little travelling-clock in its case of morocco
leather, lifted it out of the case, a dainty
thing of glass and gilding, and handed it to
Francis.</p>
<p>In the panel at the top was a small metal
knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the original case of the clock,&rdquo;
said Desmond. &ldquo;You see, it is a little too
large for it. The new case does not contain
the spring usually found to actuate the knob
of the repeater . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The repeater?&rdquo; exclaimed Francis. &ldquo;The
repeater, Des.?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>And he pressed the knob. There was a
little whirr and a clear bell chimed nine times,
then, on another note, the clock struck thrice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine-forty-five,&rdquo; said Desmond, &ldquo;showing
conclusively that Miss Bardale was
murdered, not between eight and eight
twenty, but between nine-forty-five and ten
o&rsquo;clock. That case, concealing the repeater
mechanism, escaped the notice of the murderer
who set the hands back, as it escaped
Farandol&rsquo;s. Neither, of course, was looking
for anything of the kind. What we have
got to do now is to find out who was on the
back stairs outside Miss Bardale&rsquo;s flat between
nine-thirty and ten last night, and,
maybe, the night before as well. Whoever
it was, he came from this or one of the neighbouring
houses . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will look out from the back door
you will see that this house and the houses
on either side are all furnished with these
fire-staircases descending to a common well
or court. Since we know that the murderer
did not enter from the front, he must have
come in from the back, either from this
house or from one of the adjacent houses.
Will you go off and explore the possibilities
of this house and its neighbours? I&rsquo;m staying
on here for a bit. I&rsquo;ll take a small bet
that the murderer can&rsquo;t be far off . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Francis, grabbing his hat;
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll lose your money. He&rsquo;s over the
hills and far away with Bannington&rsquo;s report
by this time, whoever he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; said Desmond enigmatically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FOOTSTEP IN THE DARK</span></h2>
<p>At ten minutes to eight that evening
there came the rattle of nails on the
glass panels of the door of Flat 7. Desmond
opened and Francis darted in. He caught
his brother&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clubfoot!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>Swiftly Desmond laid his finger on his
lips. He turned and closed the door leading
from the hall into the little sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of Farandol&rsquo;s men is inside,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been staving him off all the
afternoon, as I&rsquo;m particularly anxious, for
the moment, to keep the police out of this&mdash;at
any rate, until I&rsquo;ve heard your story!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Francis nodded understandingly. &ldquo;For a
week,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a lame man, a foreigner with
a misshapen foot, has been a patient in the
nursing-home which occupies the second,
third, and fourth floors of the house next
door to this. He calls himself Dr. Deinwitz,
a Czecho-Slovak lawyer, and was brought
here by his son, a fair young man with a scar
on his face. The son represented that his
father was suffering from acute neurasthenia
and was in need of absolute rest and quiet.
He made it a stipulation that his father&rsquo;s
presence should be kept a secret, otherwise, he
said, he would be pestered to death by
visitors. In order to be quiet, the son insisted
that his father should have a room at
the back on the top floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond opened and clenched his hand.
&ldquo;Is he still there?&rdquo; he asked tensely.</p>
<p>Francis shook his head despondently. &ldquo;He
went out for the first time to-day to go to
the City on business. He has kept his room
on, but I doubt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s kept his room on?&rdquo; Desmond almost
shouted. &ldquo;Then all is not lost. Wait here
a second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He darted away, and presently Francis
heard him telephoning in one of the inner
rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea what a day I&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo;
said Francis when his brother came back.
&ldquo;Professional secrecy is a tremendously effective
cover against indiscreet inquiries.
Young Deinwitz, in whom, of course, I recognized
Clubfoot&rsquo;s aide, Heinrich, seems
to have subtly conveyed to the fellow who
runs this nursing-home that his father was
on the verge of lunacy. Naturally the matron
and all of them shut up like oysters
when I came barging in with direct questions
at the front door. I had to get a letter of
introduction from a pal of mine in Harley
Street before I finally got into the place.
I flatter myself I was rather good as a nerve
specialist from Sheffield with a rich patient
to &lsquo;place&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond laughed happily. &ldquo;Disguise,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only cheek pads and a toupet! But what
are you looking so cheerful about? Old Clubfoot
has given us the slip properly this
time . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond slipped his arm in his brother&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Come inside and meet Sergeant Rushbrooke,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Francis found that the girl&rsquo;s body had been
taken away, but otherwise no attempt had
been made to repair the disorder of the
rooms. In an armchair in the sitting-room
was a fresh-faced, blue-eyed young man
whom Desmond introduced as Sergeant
Rushbrooke.</p>
<p>A bell pealed through the flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bannington!&rdquo; announced Desmond, and
hurried to the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got your telephone message,&rdquo; said the
Air Marshal, coming into the sitting-room.
&ldquo;Have you any news for me, Okewood?
My God, this suspense is awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out two trembling hands towards
the young man. Desmond was fumbling in
the inside pocket of his coat. He drew forth
a thick wad of blue foolscap, folded twice
across, which he handed to his visitor.</p>
<p>Bannington snatched at it and, with an
eagerness that was almost painful to behold,
unfolded it, scrutinized it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Lord! You&rsquo;ve saved me!&rdquo; he
gasped and dropped limply into a chair.
&ldquo;How can I ever thank you, Okewood?
Man alive, it&rsquo;s a miracle! Tell me all about
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Des.!&rdquo; exclaimed Francis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Sergeant Rushbrooke opened wide his blue
eyes. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say anything about this
to me, sir,&rdquo; he observed in rather a ruffled
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be kept in suspense much
longer, Sergeant,&rdquo; said Desmond, and
glanced at his watch.</p>
<p>He turned to the Air Marshal. &ldquo;This was
the way of it, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Last night
Miss Bardale was seated there at her typewriter
typing out your report with her back
to the bedroom door. The time was somewhere
about ten o&rsquo;clock. Suddenly from behind
her she hears a noise in the kitchen.
Her first thought is not for herself, but for
her duty to you. She snatches up her papers&mdash;your
original and the two pages of the
fair copy she had made&mdash;and puts them in
a place of safety before she turns to meet
her murderer. When she sees his face, she
attempts to flee back into the sitting-room.
But, before she can escape, he is on her,
choking out her life with his great hairy
hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then follows the frantic search to find
what he had committed murder to discover, a
search frantic, yet methodical in its way,
room by room, as you may see. It was the
circumstance that he had prolonged the
search to the very kitchen that made me
think he had possibly not achieved his object.
So I took up the hunt where he had left off
and . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He produced from a drawer in the table a
filmy mass of pink edged with lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had rolled your papers up in her
nightdress and put it back under the pillow.
I found it wedged between the bed and the
wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Bannington blew his nose
violently. &ldquo;But who was the murderer?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Again Desmond consulted his watch. &ldquo;I
may be able to answer that question later,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;For the moment the sooner you
get that report in a place of safety the better,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with you,&rdquo; replied
Bannington. &ldquo;Are you and your brother
coming along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond shook his head. &ldquo;My work isn&rsquo;t
finished yet! But Francis will escort you
back to the Air Ministry . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need, I assure you,&rdquo; said Bannington.
&ldquo;I have my car outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; Desmond urged, &ldquo;it would
be better for you to have an escort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis drew his brother aside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no
use trying to get me out of the way, Des.,&rdquo;
he told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got something up your
sleeve. Now, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was smiling, but his brother remained
serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The important thing,&rdquo; Desmond said, &ldquo;is
to get that report away quickly. Bannington
has no idea of the danger he runs.
When you&rsquo;ve seen his memorandum into the
safe, come back here by all means. If I&rsquo;m
not here I&rsquo;ll be at the Yard. I may have
some news for you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond leaned forward and whispered in
his brother&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Francis started. Then he said: &ldquo;But I
can&rsquo;t leave you to face it alone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be alone,&rdquo; Desmond answered.
&ldquo;Sergeant Rushbrooke is here to keep me
company, and I have asked the Yard to send
me down half a dozen men. Farandol was
not there when I telephoned just now, but
his substitute promised to send at once.
They should be here by this. If you should
meet them below, send the man in charge
up to me, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Okewood, are you ready?&rdquo; Bannington
came out of the hall with his hat on
his head. He held out his hand to Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I can show my gratitude for what
you have done for me this night,&rdquo; he said
with deep feeling, &ldquo;believe me I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said Desmond
as he accompanied them to the door. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo; corrected Francis smilingly
as he followed the Air Marshal out.</p>
<p>For full five minutes after they had gone,
Desmond remained standing in the hall, sunk
in his thoughts. He was interrupted by
Sergeant Rushbrooke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir!&rdquo; said the plain-clothes
man, &ldquo;but I believe there&rsquo;s some one on the
stairs outside!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Like a flash Desmond&rsquo;s hand shot out at
the electric-light switch at the door of the
sitting-room. There was a click and the
room was plunged in darkness. Desmond
pulled out an automatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have your gun ready!&rdquo; he whispered to
the detective. &ldquo;Keep very quiet, but be prepared
to shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The flat was in complete darkness. Before
them, as they crouched behind the table,
they saw the dim outline of the bedroom
door. Beyond, where the kitchen lay, was
blackness.</p>
<p>Very faintly, from the obscurity before
them, a key rattled. Presently the cold night
air softly brushed their faces. At the end
of the flat against a background of silver
moonlight a huge figure bulked immensely.
A door closed softly and darkness fell again.</p>
<p>A heavy limping sound approached them;
a step and a stump, a step and a stump,
muted but audible. They could hear the
floor boards straining as beneath some immense
weight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>And now that uncouth shape loomed gigantic
in the doorway of the sitting-room.
Its breadth seemed to stretch from jamb to
jamb. Some movement must have betrayed
their presence, for there came the rasp of
a harsh ejaculation. Then the room was
flooded with light and Desmond&rsquo;s voice rang
out: &ldquo;If you move I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Grundt, bareheaded, in the clothes
of rusty black he always affected, his right
hand, plumed with black hair on the back,
grasping his rubber-shod crutch-stick. He
had made a half-turn in the doorway, and
now twisted his head round to stare at his
challenger, his burning eyes blazing defiance,
his cruel, fleshy lips pursed up in a contemptuous
sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can put your hands up, Herr Doktor!&rdquo;
said Desmond. &ldquo;Quickly, please, or
there might be an accident! And you can
drop your stick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant cripple faced his aggressors
squarely. He hesitated for an instant, then,
with an almost imperceptible shrug of his
shoulders, he slowly raised his hands, his
stick rattling to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant, would you mind . . .?&rdquo; Desmond
remarked in a colloquial tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Sergeant Rushbrooke crossed to the doorway
and, with a dexterity born of long experience,
ran his fingers lightly over the
big man&rsquo;s pockets, not forgetting, you may
be sure, the inside breast pocket, where your
professional gunman mostly carries his
weapon, or the armholes of the waistcoat,
very handy for concealing a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not armed, sir,&rdquo; he reported.</p>
<p>Desmond smiled sardonically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
getting careless, Grundt! A few years ago
you would not have been taken off your
guard like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Grundt said no word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your psychological powers are failing,
too, my dear Doctor,&rdquo; Desmond continued.
&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s wit defeated you. Celibacy has
its drawbacks. If you had been a married
man, now, you would have known that
women have as great a predilection for curious
hiding-places as a magpie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Clubfoot spoke. &ldquo;You
again!&rdquo; he said in a voice thick with anger.
&ldquo;Always you!&rdquo; His dark eyes were hot with
passion and they saw the veins swell knot-like
at his temples. &ldquo;You are beginning to
incommode me, Okewood. I must advise
you to be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Desmond laughed. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been careful
during the last few weeks, I shouldn&rsquo;t
be here to-day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know that
well enough, Grundt. However, you&rsquo;re not
going to do any more harm. Sergeant Rushbrooke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down and see if those police I asked
for are there. Explain to the man in charge
that it is essential that no one should leave
this house or the houses on either side for the
present, and ask him to be good enough to
step up here to me. When you have done
that, take a man with you and go to the
nursing-home next door and inquire whether
young Mr. Deinwitz is there. If he is, invite
him to accompany you to Scotland Yard. If
he won&rsquo;t come, kidnap him! Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the Sergeant who had learnt
discipline in the Brigade of Guards. He
seemed to hesitate. &ldquo;Will <i>you</i> be all right,
sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about me,&rdquo; Desmond
smiled. &ldquo;Dr. Grundt and I are old friends!
We shall enjoy a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>On that Rushbrooke clattered off and Desmond
turned to Clubfoot again. Grundt
seemed to have regained all his saturnine
good-humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hang for this job, my friend!&rdquo;
Desmond observed pleasantly.</p>
<p>Grundt bared his strong yellow teeth in a
smile and made a little bow. &ldquo;You have, of
course, all necessary evidence against me.
Your English justice, if I remember rightly,
is exacting on this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unwittingly Desmond flashed an inquiring
glance at him.</p>
<p>The cripple was quick to notice it and
chuckled. &ldquo;My dear Okewood,&rdquo; he remarked
suavely, &ldquo;you are too deliciously
na&iuml;ve. Lieber Freund, do you really imagine
you will ever secure the conviction of a poor
neurastheniac for murder simply because,
on the night after the tragedy, attracted by
the light and the sound of voices, he penetrated
the scene of the crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key, man, the key!&rdquo; Desmond broke
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;The key of my back door opens the back
door of this flat,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. A
large key dropped on the carpet at Desmond&rsquo;s
feet. &ldquo;Try it and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now an interruption came. There
was a ring at the front door. Three men in
plain clothes appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr. Farandol, sir,&rdquo; said the foremost
of the trio, a short, thick-set fellow
with a dark moustache. &ldquo;The Inspector was
called away to a big case at Colchester. Our
orders are to take the party to the Yard.
We&rsquo;ve a car below if you&rsquo;d care to come with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond gave a sigh of relief. &ldquo;By
George!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I certainly will!&rdquo; The
perspiration glittered on his forehead. &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t feel happy till you&rsquo;ve got him safe
under lock and key. Will you handcuff our
friend? I&rsquo;m taking no chances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spokesman of the plain-clothes men,
who gave his name as Sergeant Mackay, produced
a pair of handcuffs and clasped them
about Grundt&rsquo;s hairy wrists. Clubfoot&rsquo;s
face was an impassive mask; but his eyes
glinted dangerously.</p>
<p>They took him out of the flat and descended
the stairs in a little procession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>A closed limousine stood at the door.
They made Grundt get inside, and the sergeant
shared the back seat with him; Desmond
and one plain-clothes man sat opposite
and the other man got up beside the driver.</p>
<p class="tb">It was a raw wet night. Baker Street was
a nocturne of black and yellow. The car
drove very fast, so fast, indeed, that Desmond
drew the sergeant&rsquo;s attention to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tap on the glass, sir,&rdquo; said Mackay,
&ldquo;and tell the driver to slow down a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond turned half round. At that
moment a damp cloth was clapped on to his
face. He sprang up in a desperate effort to
evade it, for on the instant his nostrils had
detected the sickly odour of chloroform.
His head struck the roof of the car a violent
blow; the pressure on his nose and mouth
increased: he strove to breathe and felt that
sickening, cloying sweetness drawn up into
his lungs. He tried to cry out as his senses
slipped away; he sought to struggle as a
numbing warmth stole over his limbs. The
car seemed full of faces and eyes that stared
. . . especially one face, grey and
bloated with cruel, fleshy lips that grinned
and grinned . . .</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>There was a click as Grundt&rsquo;s handcuffs
fell apart. The big cripple chuckled and
tapped Sergeant Mackay on the knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that came down just now?
Heinrich settled him. The key of the office
below came in very useful, Herr Doktor!
The body is lying there now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubfoot purred his appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gut gemacht, Max, mein Junger!&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The car sped on through the dripping
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN WHICH DESMOND OKEWOOD FINDS CLUBFOOT IN STRANGE COMPANY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this spy, Okewood, under
lock and key, Herr Doktor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was sparely lighted by a single
reading-lamp with a green shade, and its
sickly rays seemed to heighten the pallor of
the speaker&rsquo;s face. He was a round-shouldered
man whose high cheek-bones and
slanting eyes betrayed his Mongol blood even
as his snuffling German jargon revealed his
race. He had a rabbit mouth, the upper lip
drawn up over long yellow teeth, and the
weakness of his chin was in part hidden by
a ragged fringe of reddish beard. He sat at
the desk, his whole body atwitch with some
nervous tic as he gnawed restlessly at his
fingers. In the burly apelike figure that
confronted him, with the relentless eyes beneath
their tufted brows, the cruel, savage
mouth and the heavy jowl, any one closely
acquainted with the dark ways of international
espionage would have recognized
the redoubtable Dr. Grundt, better known as
The Man with the Clubfoot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Slowly Grundt opened and shut his great
hairy hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him&mdash;<i>there</i>, Mandelstamm!&rdquo; he
said in a voice that purred with exultation.
&ldquo;We are old, we are exiled; but we are not
a back number yet. In this last affair of
Sir Alexander Bannington&rsquo;s report in which,
I confess, my customary good fortune failed
me, this cursed Okewood had odds of three to
one on his side. He thought he had me
cornered; but now he, not old Clubfoot, sits
in the trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled savagely with a sound that
was almost a snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that our young
friend will not altogether relish his prospects
when he awakes from his long sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drugged him, hein?&rdquo; asked the Jew.
There was something vulpine in the way he
lifted his long aquiline nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Clubfoot guffawed. &ldquo;The neatest trick!
Max, whose performance as a Scotland Yard
detective was erstklassig&mdash;kolossal!&mdash;gave
him a whiff of chloroform just to keep him
quiet! And this poor Okewood believed he
was taking me off to Scotland Yard! Donnerwetter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slapped his great thigh and laughed
uproariously. His companion&rsquo;s mouth
twitched upwards at the corners displaying
another inch or two of dripping, yellow
fangs. It was like a fox&rsquo;s grin if such a
phenomenon of natural history can be imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Soviets find that spies, like meat,
don&rsquo;t keep!&rdquo; he softly lisped. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
you kill him, Herr Doktor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Grundt answered slowly, &ldquo;because
I have other uses in view for our
enterprising young friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mandelstamm leant forward swiftly.
&ldquo;Also doch!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Clubfoot promises he accomplishes,&rdquo;
said Grundt, raising his voice menacingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; hastily agreed
<i>Tavarish</i> Mandelstamm, and slyly added:
&ldquo;Only you didn&rsquo;t secure the Bannington report,
did you, Herr Doktor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>The blood slowly mounted in the other&rsquo;s
swarthy face. &ldquo;A mere miscalculation, my
friend! It was a trifling matter, anyhow,
and I have never been able to interest myself
in bagatelles. But this commission
of yours . . .&rdquo; He glanced over
his shoulder and lowered his voice. &ldquo;Do
you realize the task you&rsquo;ve set me? Nein,
nicht wahr? Would it surprise you to learn
that within the past week the Foreign Office
has changed its codes? While the new ones
are being revised they are employing, for
Most Secret despatches, code 3A of the
Secret Service. You didn&rsquo;t know that, did
you? Come closer! Hitherto, the working
of code 3A has been known to three persons
only&mdash;to the Chief of the British Secret Service,
to his confidential ciphering clerk, and&rdquo;&mdash;he
dropped his voice to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;to
Major Desmond Okewood! . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach nein!&rdquo; exclaimed the Russian admiringly,
cracking his knuckles. &ldquo;With that
draft treaty in our hands . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P-sst!</i>&rdquo; warned Grundt, pointing at the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>A broad-shouldered man with a heavy
dark moustache stood on the threshold of
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Max?&rdquo; asked Grundt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Englishman is coming round, Herr
Doktor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubfoot looked at his watch. &ldquo;Midnight!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You did your work thoroughly,
Max!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One does what one can, Herr Doktor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Heinrich will take it in turns to
guard the Englishman throughout the night.
You can give him food. But watch him, he&rsquo;s
slippery. If he escapes . . .&rdquo; He broke
off and glared at the other. &ldquo;Go now and remember
what I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundt turned to the Russian. &ldquo;The Constantinople
courier is expected to leave
Calais for Dover by the afternoon boat.
Everything is prepared. If all goes well he
should be here soon after dark. Sleep well,
Mandelstamm! The draft treaty will be in
your hands by to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Limping heavily with his huge misshapen
foot, he hobbled briskly from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p class="tb">Desmond Okewood was emerging painfully
from a long, incoherent dream. He
found his eyes fixed on an electric bulb caged
in steel bars, and set in the ceiling high above
his head. As he gazed, the light seemed to
come and go, to appear and vanish
again . . .</p>
<p>And then, with a jerk, he was fully conscious.
With a pang the memory of the
night came rushing back. The shame of his
position almost overwhelmed him. To think
that he, Desmond Okewood, had been deceived
by the common crooks&rsquo; trick of dressing
up confederates as detectives!</p>
<p>He looked about him. He was lying on a
couch in a bare and lofty room. Heavy
oaken shutters, secured with bars of iron
solidly padlocked, excluded every vestige of
daylight. He had no idea where he was or
what the time of day might be. When he
looked for his watch, he found that his
pockets had been emptied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The house was wrapped in silence. Not a
sound came to him from without. He tried
to review the situation. His position was
desperate. Clubfoot would not spare him.
This time he was doomed beyond hope of
escape. A train of odd incidents from his
long battle of wits with the master spy came
crowding into his aching head . . .</p>
<p>Still drowsy from the drug, he must have
dropped off to sleep, for when next he opened
his eyes it was to find some one shaking his
arm. A fair-haired youth stood beside the
couch, his rather crafty face barred by a
long white scar. Desmond recognized Heinrich,
Clubfoot&rsquo;s acolyte in many an exploit.</p>
<p>On the table stood a tray decked for a
meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you want you can have,&rdquo; said
Heinrich, &ldquo;as long as it doesn&rsquo;t require cutting
with a knife. I&rsquo;ve brought you some
minced chicken and a whiskey-and-soda
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; asked Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My instructions,&rdquo; retorted the youth
with military precision, &ldquo;are to feed you.
Nothing more. I shall return in half an hour
for the tray . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I have a wash?&rdquo; demanded Desmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The youth pointed to an oaken cabinet in
the corner. &ldquo;You will find all you require
there!&rdquo; he said. Then he left the room.</p>
<p>Hot water stood ready in a brass jug.
After he had washed and eaten, Desmond
felt his strength returning. When Heinrich
came to fetch the tray, he brought a cup of
coffee and a box of cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a prison de luxe!&rdquo; remarked Desmond
brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My orders are to make you comfortable!&rdquo;
was the non-committal reply.</p>
<p>Each time the door opened, Desmond
noticed that a light burnt in the corridor.
He assumed, therefore, that it must be
evening. Consequently he must have slept
almost the round of the clock. The hours
dragged interminably on. He paced up and
down the room, smoking cigarettes, busy
with his thoughts. What had become of
Clubfoot? What was he waiting for? Why
didn&rsquo;t he come in and finish it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Slowly the numbing silence of the house,
the absence of any indication of time, the
artificial light, began to get on Desmond
Okewood&rsquo;s nerves. This restriction on his
liberty was intolerable. He looked about for
a bell. There was none. He went to the
door&mdash;it was solid oak with no lock apparent
on the inside&mdash;and began to hammer it with
his fists and feet. He pounded until he was
tired. No one came.</p>
<p>He had fallen to striding up and down the
room again when suddenly the door opened.
Heinrich came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Grundt is asking for you. Will you
come with me?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; retorted Desmond. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m particularly
anxious to have a word with the
Herr Doktor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble to try to escape,&rdquo; observed
the young man blandly as he held the
door for his prisoner. &ldquo;Doors and windows
are barred and the house is closely guarded.
You&rsquo;d only get hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warning was spoken sincerely and
carried conviction. Desmond felt his heart
sink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>It could not yet be morning, Desmond
decided, as he followed his escort down a
broad corridor with windows shuttered and
barred like that of his room. They descended
a flight of steps to a small tiled hall,
lighted, like corridor and staircase, by artificial
light. From a door that stood ajar
came the murmur of voices. Heinrich ushered
his prisoner into a long low-ceilinged
room.</p>
<p>Four men were seated at the end of an
oval table, their faces indistinctly seen
through a thin haze of blue tobacco smoke
that drifted in the close air.</p>
<p>Grundt presided at the head of the board,
a round-shouldered, red-bearded Jew on his
right, a grossly plebeian-looking man with a
face the colour of suet, thin greyish hair
plastered across a shining bald pate, and a
great paunch, sprawling in the chair on his
left. Next to him was a middle-aged man
with a stiff grey beard and a stiff face who
sat bolt upright, his hands folded in his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, Major,&rdquo; said Clubfoot cordially,
and pointed to a chair next to the Jew.
&ldquo;Mr. Blund, the cigars are with you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The full, deep voice was courteous, even
genial, and a jovial smile played about the
full lips. Desmond took the proffered chair,
but waved aside the box of Partagas which
the fat man pushed in his direction. He
felt his hands growing cold. By bitter experience
he knew that Clubfoot was never
so dangerous as in these moments of expansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fortune of war!&rdquo; Grundt resumed.
&ldquo;You played your cards admirably . . .
up to a point, lieber Okewood! I have always
said you were an opponent worthy of my
steel. Perhaps, in this instance, you were
just a trifle . . . shall we say over-confident? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond, who had been taking stock of
his surroundings, pulled himself resolutely
together. The bland self-assurance of
Grundt, he noticed, was far from being
shared by his companions. The Jew was a
mass of nerves, rapaciously tearing at his
yellow, deeply bitten finger-nails, the little
pig eyes of the fat man were restless with
apprehension, and there was an air of tension
about the very rigidity of the enigmatical
greybeard across the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;You and your rather unsavoury accomplices
are playing a dangerous game, Herr
Doktor,&rdquo; he said as bravely as he might.
&ldquo;The riff-raff of international espionage&rdquo;&mdash;he
paused and gazed with cool deliberation
first at the Jew at his side and then at Greybeard&mdash;&ldquo;live
from hand to mouth, as we
all know, and cannot be over-scrupulous.
But I must say I wonder what an Englishman&rdquo;&mdash;he
stared pointedly at the fat man as
he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;is doing in your ill-favoured
company!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat man struggled up in his chair
with malice depicted in every feature of his
leaden-hued face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep a civil tongue in your &rsquo;ead,
d&rsquo;jeer?&rdquo; he spluttered.</p>
<p>But Clubfoot laid a hairy paw on his
sleeve. &ldquo;Let us make allowances for Major
Okewood&rsquo;s natural chagrin,&rdquo; he counselled.
&ldquo;Believe me, he is full of common sense.
He will presently recognize the value of
being polite and . . . and obliging with
us . . . otherwise&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and
looked amiably round the board&mdash;&ldquo;otherwise
we shall have to teach him manners, eh,
Tarock?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;A gord round the head, with some hardt
knots, tvisted vith a baionette vould be a
good lesson to him,&rdquo; muttered the grey-bearded
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hasty, Tarock,&rdquo; said Grundt
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Not</i> Tarock, of Cracow?&rdquo; exclaimed
Desmond. &ldquo;Why, now, isn&rsquo;t that interesting?
I&rsquo;ve heard of you so often, and we&rsquo;ve
never met. Let&rsquo;s see, you commanded a
company once in the Deutschmeister Regiment
in Vienna, didn&rsquo;t you? And were
cashiered for stealing the company
money . . .?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greybeard moved uneasily in his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity that the white-slave traffic
laws interfered with your new career at
Cracow!&rdquo; Desmond resumed impassively.
&ldquo;So many of your colleagues regard them
as the most unfair restriction of trade!
Dear, dear! Was it five or seven years
Zuchthaus they gave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr!&rdquo; thundered Tarock, springing to
his feet.</p>
<p>The fox-grin had again appeared about
the thin lips of Mr. Mandelstamm. Clubfoot,
too, appeared to be enjoying the scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Personally, I always admired your versatility
as a spy,&rdquo; Desmond went on, leaning
back out of reach of Tarock&rsquo;s threatening
fist, &ldquo;though the Austrians didn&rsquo;t. They
sacked you for double-crossing, didn&rsquo;t they,
Tarock? And the Russians followed suit a
year later. You were too dirty even for the
Okhrana to touch . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kreuzsakrament!&rdquo; roared Greybeard,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have your life for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His chair overturned with a crash.
Everybody had sprung to his feet, talking at
the same time. Suddenly the door of the
room burst open and three men came tumbling
in. Two of them were grappling with
a third, who, though gagged and bound and
bleeding, was plunging wildly and uttering
stifled shouts of rage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CONSTANTINOPLE COURIER</span></h2>
<p>An ear-splitting report sent them all
reeling back. The air stank with
the fumes of burnt cordite. Then Clubfoot&rsquo;s
voice went booming through the room. A
great automatic was smoking in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next shot will go through your head,
Bewlay,&rdquo; he roared at the prisoner who,
on the report of the pistol, had momentarily
ceased struggling. &ldquo;Stand back there,
Tarock,&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no brawling
here. Sit down, all of you! Heinrich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young German appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Major Okewood on one side, and,
if he attempts to escape, shoot him! Max,
you look after Bewlay! Have you got the
bags? Bring them in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>The dominating personality of the man
was extraordinary. Complete silence fell
upon the room. The men at the table resumed
their seats. Heinrich led Desmond
into a corner while Max unceremoniously
pitched the other prisoner on to a window-seat,
where he lay motionless. He looked
like an Englishman, young and of athletic
build, with close-cropped fair hair, now stiff
with matted blood from a great cut across
the head.</p>
<p>A man staggered into the room, his arms
piled high with white and green canvas bags
sealed with red wax. With a sickening heart
Desmond recognized them. They were the
valises of the King&rsquo;s Messenger. &ldquo;Bewlay,&rdquo;
Grundt had called this fresh prisoner. Desmond
remembered the name now. Paul
Bewlay was the Constantinople courier.</p>
<p>The bags were tumbled in a heap on the
table. With scissors and knives Grundt and
his companions busied themselves with cutting
the strings that bound them. Soon
the table was heaped high with a litter of
letters, documents, newspapers, and packages.</p>
<p>Presently Clubfoot looked up from the
work. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve searched him, Max?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jawohl, Herr Doktor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>The man took from his pocket a red bandana
handkerchief, heavily weighted down,
and handed it to Tarock. The Austrian
spilled out a mixed assortment of objects,
a watch and chain, a gold cigarette-case, a
pencil, and a little silver brooch&mdash;the Silver
Greyhound, the messenger&rsquo;s badge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve looked in the lining of his clothes,
Max?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja, Herr Doktor. There is nothing
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening of the packages revealed
some curious things. There was an old brass
lamp, a pair of Jodhpore breeches, a couple
of Samarcand rugs, and some boxes of Turkish
Delight, enjoying, in strange promiscuity,
the hospitality of the diplomatic valise.
In the way of odd commissions, a King&rsquo;s
Messenger is as useful as the village carrier.</p>
<p>The rummaging went on. Then Desmond
heard Mandelstamm&rsquo;s reedy lisp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your customary good fortune has failed
you again, Herr Doktor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unsinn!&rdquo; came the angry retort. &ldquo;It
must be here. He has been under observation
every step of the way. Patience, my
friend! We shall find it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>The work was resumed in silence until
at length Mandelstamm left the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless!&rdquo; he cried, his voice shrill
with vexation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting our time,
Herr Doktor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarock, too, had left his seat and was
whispering to Blund, the fat Englishman,
in a corner. Grundt remained alone at the
table. His bulging brows were furrowed in
thought. Then, as though struck by a sudden
idea, he picked up one of the round
boxes of Turkish Delight, raised the lid and
shook the contents out upon the table. A
second, a third, and a fourth box he treated
in the same manner, and then, with a whoop
of joy, he plunged his hand into the sticky
pile of sweetmeats before him. When he
withdrew his hand he held a number of
sheets of white flimsy paper between finger
and thumb. Dusting the fine sugar off them,
he held them up for all to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Mandelstamm,&rdquo; he said cuttingly,
&ldquo;perhaps this will teach you that Dr. Grundt
does not promise what he cannot fulfil!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>But a ringing voice from the window-seat
broke in upon his words. &ldquo;You damned
scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s Messenger was standing erect.
The soiled scarf that had gagged him had
slipped aside. He was bound round with
rope like a mummy in its wrappings, and
his face was almost irrecognizable with the
smother of dried blood that had welled from
the wound in his head. But he stood up
and shouted his defiance into the room as
though he, and not Clubfoot, were the master
there.</p>
<p>Grundt looked up slowly. &ldquo;Max,&rdquo; he said,
without raising his voice, &ldquo;take him away
and get rid of him. He is of no further use
to us,&rdquo; he explained to the men at the table,
while Max fell upon his victim.</p>
<p>With alacrity Tarock scrambled to his
feet, drawing something from his hip pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to him!&rdquo; he said in a voice
hoarse with pleasurable excitement. And he
hurried from the room behind Max and his
prisoner.</p>
<p>As he passed, Desmond, covered by Heinrich&rsquo;s
automatic, saw that the Austrian carried
in his hand a long Norwegian knife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Mandelstamm extended talon-like fingers
towards the paper in Clubfoot&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L-l-let me s-s-see.&rdquo; He stuttered with
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in code,&rdquo; said Grundt.</p>
<p>And all eyes turned to Desmond.</p>
<p>Grundt heaved himself up and, grasping
his rubber-shod stick, hobbled awkwardly
across the room to where Heinrich guarded
the prisoner. The cripple waved the guard
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okewood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are clever
enough to know when you are beaten. I
am well aware that your motto has ever
been, &lsquo;While there&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s hope!&rsquo; but
let me assure you that in this instance you
can derive very little solace from that saying.
The position of this house is so remote, its
precincts are so well guarded, that, even if
your friends were to discover your hiding-place&mdash;which
is most unlikely&mdash;and were in
hot cry hither, I should have ample leisure
to devise and carry out even the most
lingering form of death for you.&rdquo; He
paused and scrutinized the young man&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;I offer you your life on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Desmond remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it interest you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long-drawn-out, gurgling scream, high-pitched
and shrill with the extremity of
agony, suddenly broke the brooding stillness
of the house. It was followed by a little
muffled cry from the room. From behind a
typewriter placed on a desk in the corner a
young girl had risen hesitatingly, one hand
clutching her cheek, terror in her eyes. Desmond
had not noticed her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xenia!&rdquo; Mandelstamm cried harshly.</p>
<p>Listlessly the girl sank back into her seat.</p>
<p>Desmond looked straight into Clubfoot&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;What was that? Who screamed?&rdquo;
he asked, knowing full well the answer to his
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must have been Bewlay,&rdquo;
calmly replied Grundt; and asked again:
&ldquo;Does my proposition interest you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, lieber Okewood,&rdquo; Clubfoot
resumed persuasively, &ldquo;murder in cold blood
is not one of my hobbies. One has to kill
at times, but it is always a messy business
unless one has the resources of a well-stocked
laboratory at one&rsquo;s back. Listen to me. I
have here a message in your Secret Service
code number 3A. If you will decipher it
for us, you shall go free. We are willing to
give you any reasonable guarantee of your
life . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I tell you that I know nothing
of this code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would not be true, my friend!
Besides yourself, there are only two persons
who, before the Foreign Office adopted it,
were acquainted with its cipher . . .
your revered Chief (a remarkable man, my
dear Okewood, and a credit to our profession!)
and his confidential clerk, by name
Collins, I believe, who lives at Hatfield. Am
I correct? No, no, my friend, you won&rsquo;t try
to deceive me. Old Clubfoot knows too
much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I reject your offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that terrible scream rang out, suddenly
checked this time and dying away in
a strangling gurgle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>With an expressive movement of eyes and
head Grundt indicated the upper regions of
the house, now plunged once more into silence,
as much as to say: &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
drive us to <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond Okewood put out his hand.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see the despatch!&rdquo; he said brusquely.</p>
<p>But Clubfoot held up a deprecating paw.
&ldquo;No, no, my friend, not so fast,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;You might tear it or . . . or drop it in
the fire. I&rsquo;ve been at a deal of trouble to
get it.&rdquo; He raised his voice. &ldquo;Fr&auml;ulein
Xenia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl came slowly over from her corner.
She was a slender, graceful creature, with
slim hands and feet, glossy hair of jet-black
brushed smoothly down to conceal her ears,
and the clear, wide-open eyes of a child.
As she stood before the big cripple waiting
to hear his bidding, she let her black eyes
rest for a moment on Desmond&rsquo;s face. They
were honest eyes, dark and appealing. Somehow
he drew comfort from them.</p>
<p>Grundt handed her the despatch. &ldquo;Sit
down over there at the machine and make me
one copy of this. Be very careful and check
the ciphers carefully! Verstehen Sie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ich verstehe, Herr Doktor!&rdquo; she answered
in a low voice, pleasant of timbre, but
lifeless and toneless.</p>
<p>As she crossed the room the door opened.
Tarock had returned. He was red in the
face and out of breath, and there was an air
of stealthy guilt about him that chilled Desmond
to the very marrow. He could not
save now, but only avenge poor Bewlay. If
his own hour were near, as he had a shrewd
suspicion it was, he meant, so he promised
himself, to risk all, if needs be, to send the
Cracow <i>souteneur</i> to precede him at the
Judgment Seat.</p>
<p>The brisk rattle of the typewriter fell upon
the quietness of the room. How matter-of-fact
it sounded! They might have been in
a lawyer&rsquo;s office, not in this house of twilight
death, whence time and the daylight were
excluded.</p>
<p>The girl had finished her typing. Her
black head was bowed over her table. She
was revising the long list of numbers. In a
minute, Desmond told himself, he must make
up his mind how to act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Now she had crossed the room: now she
was giving the despatch and the copy to
Clubfoot. Was Bewlay really dead? Or
would he scream again? . . .</p>
<p>Clubfoot was speaking: &ldquo;. . . Which
is it to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond cleared his throat. All his
senses were alert now. Those dreadful cries
had stung him into action. He must gain
time&mdash;time. By this the Chief and Francis,
his brother, than whom there were no
greater masters of their craft alive, would
be busy with plans for his rescue. But they
must have time to get on his track, unless he
were too securely hidden away for them ever
to find him . . . time, time . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the despatch!&rdquo; Desmond exclaimed
suddenly. Silently, his suspicious
eyes searching the other&rsquo;s face, Clubfoot
handed over the typewritten sheets. Desmond
studied them. Then, with a shake of
the head: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decipher it like this,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Have you any dictionaries here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A glimmer of triumph shot into Grundt&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;What dictionary do you want?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peereboom&rsquo;s English-Dutch Dictionary,
the edition of 1898,&rdquo; Desmond answered
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for it. It&rsquo;ll be in your hands
within the hour!&rdquo; Clubfoot retorted and
clapped him, almost affectionately, on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>Then they took Desmond back to his room.
In the corridor on the first floor they passed
the body of the courier, lying, still swathed in
his bonds, lifeless, in a welter of blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">XENIA</span></h2>
<p>Dictionary codes are familiar in the
Secret Service as furnishing a cipher
which, without the key, defies detection. By
asking for a dictionary at random, without
reference to the cipher before him, Desmond
had hoped to gain a respite of several hours;
for he had reckoned that the little-known and
out-of-date work which he had requested
would not easily be forthcoming. Clubfoot&rsquo;s
glib promise that the book would be on hand
within the hour dashed his hopes considerably,
and he re&euml;ntered his prison seriously
revolving in his head his chances of escape.</p>
<p>Of chances, properly speaking, he had
none. He had no knowledge of the geography
of the house or its location; he had
no arms; he had no accomplices. But the
murder of Paul Bewlay had made him reckless.
The sight of the body of that defenseless
man, done to death in his bonds, filled
his soul with rage. He must try to fight his
way out. But how?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>He heard the door grate. Heinrich was
there with a tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought your dinner!&rdquo; he said. His
tone was infinitely more genial than before.</p>
<p>Desmond stared at him blankly. &ldquo;The
mince you served me for lunch was cold,&rdquo;
he grumbled presently. &ldquo;What have you got
there? Poached eggs? Hmph! And how
am I going to eat eggs without salt or pepper?
Good God, if I&rsquo;m going to work for
you, can&rsquo;t I be decently served?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr, Herr,&rdquo; stammered Heinrich, &ldquo;the
cruet is outside. A little minute and I bring
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond grunted and turned away. But
not so that he could not keep the door under
observation. In a moment Heinrich was
back with the cruet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Herr!&rdquo; he remarked and dumped it
down on the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>But the Herr was still not satisfied.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought me tea to drink!&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;Do you take me for a teetotaller
or what? Where&rsquo;s Grundt? Send for
Grundt . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr, Herr,&rdquo; wailed Heinrich in an
agony of apprehension, &ldquo;anything he wished
for, the Herr was to have, said the Herr
Doktor! What can I get you, Herr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better!&rdquo; said Desmond. &ldquo;You
can get me a large whiskey-and-soda. And
not too much soda, d&rsquo;you hear? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently Heinrich galloped from the
room. The moment his back was turned
Desmond was at the cruet. He whipped out
the pepper castor, rapidly screwed the top off,
and tiptoed swiftly to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dirty trick!&rdquo; he murmured to himself.
&ldquo;A dirty Apache trick! Okewood, I&rsquo;m
ashamed of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the door swung back. On the threshold
stood Heinrich beaming, a brimming
club tumbler in his hand. Suddenly, with a
shrill gasp of agony, the youth snatched at
his eyes and the glass shattered on the floor.
Desmond flung the empty pepper-pot away
and dashed through the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Running on the points of his toes he bolted
along the corridor making in the direction of
the staircase. Just as he reached it, he
heard a heavy step mounting the stairs and
the shining bald pate of Mr. Blund, the
Englishman, appeared on a level with the
landing.</p>
<p>The collision was as violent as it was inevitable.
By the force of the impact Mr.
Blund was flung back against the stair-rail.
But he had thrown his arms about Desmond
and now clung to him like grim death,
screeching in a voice wheezy with fear and
excitement: &ldquo;&rsquo;Elp! &rsquo;Elp! &rsquo;E&rsquo;s escaping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a savage twist Desmond wrenched
himself loose. But there is a dogged strain
in even the worst Englishman, and Mr.
Blund came at him again. With open hand
Desmond struck upwards at the other&rsquo;s double
chin that sagged in heavy folds to the
thick neck. The violence of the blow, half
slap, half push, threw the fat man off his
balance. He reeled away, slipped on the polished
boards, and, with a hoarse cry, toppled
backwards over the banisters into the well
of the staircase, and, with a horrid, soft
thud, landed on the tiles of the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>But the other gave him not a thought.
From the corridor behind him resounded the
angry bellowing of Heinrich. Without considering
where he was going, Desmond
plunged down the staircase and came to the
hall where, loose, like a sack of bottles, the
sprawling hulk of what had once been Mr.
Blund was lying.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the distance a door banged.
A curtain hung across one side of the hall.
In a flash Desmond parted it. Facing him
he found the front door with an immense
lock and no vestige of a key. He tried the
door. It was locked!</p>
<p>Behind him now all the house was in an
uproar. A hubbub of angry voices came
from the upper floors and heavy footsteps
thundered above him. Stealthily he peered
out from behind the curtain and came face to
face with Mandelstamm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>The Jew was standing there listening, his
head half inclined to the stairway. He was
not two feet away, a magnificent mark, and,
to simplify matters, he turned his head
precisely at the right moment to bring the
point of his jaw in contact with Desmond&rsquo;s
fist as, without hesitation, the young man
drove at him. Mandelstamm collapsed instantly
in a sitting position, then flopped
over, grunted once, and lay still.</p>
<p>Clubfoot&rsquo;s stentorian voice went booming
through the house, shouting orders. Save
for Blund and Mandelstamm, the whole of
the party seemed to have been collected on
one of the upper floors. Now they all came
trooping noisily down.</p>
<p>The little hall with the locked door behind
him was, Desmond realized, a cul-de-sac, a
veritable death-trap. Three doors faced
him across the hall. With one stride the
young man was across the Jew&rsquo;s body and,
choosing the middle door at random, opened
it swiftly and slipped through.</p>
<p>He found himself in the room where, less
than an hour before, he had confronted Clubfoot
and his confederates. Seated at the
oval table in the centre was the girl they had
called Mademoiselle Xenia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Loud exclamations from the hall, showing
that the party had discovered their casualties,
warned Desmond of the urgent danger of his
position. There was a key on the inside of
the door. He turned it and slipped it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the fat Englishman cry out&rdquo;&mdash;the
girl was speaking in her dull, listless voice&mdash;&ldquo;I
wondered if you were free. But there
is no escape from <i>him</i>. Why, oh, why, did
you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hand pounded noisily on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xenia, Xenia!&rdquo; came in Tarock&rsquo;s gruff
voice.</p>
<p>Desmond turned swiftly to the girl. &ldquo;Will
you help me?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With wonder in her mournful black eyes
she nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no way out of this room except
by the door?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The windows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are shuttered and barred with
steel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then help me to barricade the door!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Already some one outside was hurling his
weight against it. But the oaken panels were
solid and held well. With great difficulty
Desmond and the girl dragged a tall black
cupboard across the room and stood it before
the door, subsequently re&euml;nforcing the
barricade with a steel filing-cabinet, the
heavy mahogany table laid on its side, and an
intricate zareba of chairs.</p>
<p>Something cold was laid in Desmond&rsquo;s
hand. It was a Browning pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has seven shots,&rdquo; said Xenia. &ldquo;I used
to think I might use it one day, but . . .&rdquo;
She shrugged her shoulders and relapsed
into her habitual mournful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; exclaimed Desmond. &ldquo;This
puts new heart into the defence. The name
of Tarock, of Cracow, is written on one of
these bullets, did you know that, Mademoiselle
Xenia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time the girl became animated.
A little warmth stole into her olive cheeks
and her dark eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo; she said passionately. &ldquo;Kill
him for me! Deliver me from this man and
I will kiss your feet! Kill him slowly, make
him suffer as he has made me and my family
suffer! . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do what we can!&rdquo; said Desmond
cheerfully. The cold caress of the automatic
had raised his spirits a hundred per cent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>A desperate assault was being delivered on
the door. It groaned and creaked and the
barricade before it rocked and swayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; said Desmond, furrowing
his forehead. With an anxious glance
at the door, he crossed to the window. The
steel bars were deep-sunk in the face of the
shutter and padlocked in the centre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shot would burst that lock!&rdquo; remarked
the young man, fingering his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Useless!&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;The window
is barred outside. There is no escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the light went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Desmond. &ldquo;Clubfoot would
think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was pitch-dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xenia,&rdquo; he called softly, &ldquo;where are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said her soft voice in his ear. And
her hand was gently laid on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must try to be brave,&rdquo; he encouraged
her. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re going to rush us! The
door will go in a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Already a broad chink of light showed
that, though the lock yet held, the upper part
of the door was yielding to the savage battering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not frightened,&rdquo; Xenia made
answer&mdash;and her voice was quite steady&mdash;&ldquo;I
shall be glad to die! You will make it
easy for me. It is long since I knew a man
without fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She placed her hand, small and warm
and soft, in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, my little sister, my two
brothers, they are all in the prisons of the
Tcheka,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am hostage for them.
Tarock was the commissary who denounced
them. He brought me here as his secretary.
For almost a year now I have been in his
power. So you see I am happy to die . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the door gave. There was a crash as
the topmost pile of chairs hurtled to the
ground. A broad beam of light clove the
darkness about the barricade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okewood&rdquo;&mdash;the challenge came in Clubfoot&rsquo;s
deep voice&mdash;&ldquo;the game&rsquo;s up! Come
out quietly before you&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Desmond&rsquo;s hand squeezed hard the little
hand that lay in his palm. &ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;And listen! Do you hear anything
outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above the hubbub in the hall outside there
fell upon their ears the distant throb of a car.</p>
<p>Then he raised his voice. &ldquo;Grundt,&rdquo; he
cried out distinctly, &ldquo;Grundt, you can go to
hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bearded face with dangerous, bloodshot
eyes appeared in the chink between door and
jamb. Desmond shot so swiftly that the
roar of the report, Tarock&rsquo;s sharp exclamation,
and the thud of the body sounded almost
as one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Gott!&rdquo; bellowed Clubfoot. There
was a loud explosion and a bullet &ldquo;whooshed&rdquo;
above the heads of the man and girl. The
door was forced wider and the barricade was
split in twain.</p>
<p>Desmond pressed the girl to her knees.
&ldquo;Keep your head down!&rdquo; he whispered, and
fired again. The yellow flame from his
pistol lit up the darkened room. The odour
of burnt powder hung on the stale air. A
volley of shots from without answered him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>But now loud knocking resounded from
the outer hall. Instantly the light beyond the
door went out. There was the scuffle of feet
and Clubfoot&rsquo;s voice crying aloud: &ldquo;Turn on
the light again. The front door is solid.
If we go, we&rsquo;ll take the Englishman with us.
Ah, you miserable hounds! you . . .!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one brief, terrible instant a brilliant
orange glare lighted the dark gap between
the barricade and the door. Then there came
the deafening roar of an explosion immediately
followed by the sound of splintering
wood and the tinkle of broken glass. The
whole house seemed to shudder and settle
down again. Then came a moment of absolute
silence, and in the stillness the girl heard
a stealthy clip-clop, clip-clop across the tiles
of the hall.</p>
<p>And then came shouts and the sound of
the crunching and smashing of wood under
heavy blows. A voice without cried twice:
&ldquo;Desmond! Desmond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the darkness the girl sought the companion
at her side. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;We are saved!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>There was no reply. She stretched out
her hand, groping in the place where Desmond
Okewood had stood. But he was no
longer there. Outside resounded the trampling
of heavy feet, and with a sudden crash
the barricade before the door was flung down.
A beam of white light from an electric torch
clove the darkness. In its ray Xenia saw
Desmond Okewood lying motionless at her
feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN WHICH CHECK PROVES TO BE CHECKMATE</span></h2>
<p>When Desmond came to his senses
he was propped up in a limousine
that was slowly threading a broad street
crowded with trams and other traffic. The
Chief was at his side and, on the opposite
seat, Francis with the girl whose pale face,
dark eyes, and glossy black hair were vaguely
familiar.</p>
<p>With a bewildered expression the young
man looked from one face to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the Mile End Road, old man,
going home,&rdquo; said his brother, patting him
on the knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Clubfoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escaped down the river by launch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond took the girl&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I remember
it all now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was this brave
girl that saved us. She gave me the automatic
with which I was able to keep them
off until you came. Without that gun . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t talk any more now if I were
you,&rdquo; the Chief counselled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Desmond, &ldquo;except
that my head is buzzing like a beehive.
What happened to me exactly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were hit by a ricochet off your precious
barricade,&rdquo; his brother replied. &ldquo;Actually
it only grazed your temple, but it put
you down for the count . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Escaped
by launch, did he?&rdquo; he remarked presently.
&ldquo;Francis, where <i>was</i> this house to
which they took me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down on the Thames flats, between
Rainham and Purfleet,&rdquo; said his brother;
&ldquo;about as lonely a spot as they could find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how on earth did you locate me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okewood,&rdquo; interposed the Chief with
finality, &ldquo;you are talking too much. That
story, like yours, will have to keep!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Actually it only kept until the following
day, when Desmond, his head romantically
bound up in a bandage, entertained the Chief
and Francis to lunch at his chambers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;For our providential arrival,&rdquo; remarked
the Chief, neatly spearing the cherry in his
cocktail as they stood round the fire, &ldquo;you
can thank this brother of yours! Two nights
ago you vanished off the face of the earth.
We had no description of the man who kidnapped
you beyond that of old Clubfoot;
we had no particulars at all of the car, no
inkling of the route you took. And how do
you think Francis here grappled with <i>that</i>
situation? Tell him yourself, man!&rdquo; The
Chief chuckled and drained his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Francis slowly, &ldquo;it was a
long shot, for I reckoned the odds at about
a hundred to one on Clubfoot murdering you
right off. But I thought there was a chance
he might hold you to ransom or something
of the sort; in that case he would have to
have a secure retreat to which he could convey
you. That retreat, I figured to myself,
must be within a reasonable distance of London,
for Clubfoot&rsquo;s business is here. So,
within an hour of your disappearance, I arranged
for an inquiry to be sent by telephone
or telegram to every house and estate agent
within a radius of fifty miles of London as
to whether a house had recently been let to
any one answering Clubfoot&rsquo;s description. I
offered a reward of five hundred pounds for
the information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;By noon I had my answer. They rang
up from Marlow and Wadding&rsquo;s, the big
West-End agents, to say that one of their
clerks had an important statement to make.
In due course the man arrived. He had gone
down one day last week to inspect on behalf
of a client a property close to the river some
miles from Purfleet, a place called Rushdene
Grange. When he reached the house, he
found that it showed evident signs of occupation,
for smoke was rising from the
chimneys, though all the windows were shuttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He supposed that the house had been
placed in the hands of more than one agent
for disposal and had been let without the
knowledge of his firm. He was standing at
the front door when a car came up the drive.
A big lame man, answering in every particular
to the description of our friend
Grundt, got out. He told the clerk very
gruffly that the place was let and vanished
into the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;From inquiries my informant made locally
he ascertained that the house had been
let furnished to a man named Fitzroy, which,
the police tell me, is one of the various aliases
of Schmetterding, alias Blund, an old friend
of ours, Des., for, if you remember, it was
he who took that place at Harlesden for
Grundt in the affair of the purple cabriolet.
When we picked up the poor gentleman with
his neck so picturesquely broken at the foot
of the staircase at Rushdene Grange, Manderton
recognized him at once. He&rsquo;s an
Englishman of German extraction, with a
fine list of convictions against him at the
Yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis looked at his brother and smiled.
&ldquo;A little rough with him, weren&rsquo;t you, Des.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came butting in when I was trying to
escape,&rdquo; replied Desmond, &ldquo;so I landed him
a punch, and he went backwards over the
stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was Tarock on his face in the
hall with a bullet in his temple . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;As dead as a door-nail!&rdquo; Francis replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I nailed him,&rdquo; Desmond remarked,
and added, addressing the Chief,
&ldquo;Tarock, of Cracow, you know, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man nodded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no loss,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d lived too long, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what my house agent friend told
me,&rdquo; Francis resumed, &ldquo;we guessed that the
house would be a regular fortress. So I
took a charge of guncotton with the cutting-out
party the Chief let me organize and blew
the lock off the front door. How Clubfoot
escaped being killed by the explosion I don&rsquo;t
know. When we got in, we found the nest
empty except for that choice specimen, Mandelstamm,
who was spitting teeth into the
basin in the bath-room out of the most
beautiful mouth you ever saw. Whew, Des.,
you must have fetched him a clip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He walked into my fist,&rdquo; his brother retorted,
grinning. &ldquo;But what about Grundt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he got away through my
fault. The shooting inside the house rather
rattled me . . . on account of you, you
know . . . and I blew the lock before
our men had got into their stations at the
back. Clubfoot must have escaped through
the basement and got down to the river, for
we discovered afterwards that an electric
launch he used to keep up a creek had disappeared.
I presume he took Max and Heinrich
with him. They left poor Bewlay where
they killed him upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died well,&rdquo; said Desmond, giving him
his epitaph. He turned to the Chief. &ldquo;And
this treaty, sir? Clubfoot has got away with
it, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has!&rdquo; replied the big man grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was under the impression that it was
coded in 3A,&rdquo; Desmond went on. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t,
you know, though I didn&rsquo;t disabuse his mind,
of course. It was in no code <i>I</i> had ever seen
before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or will ever see again. The only two
keys in existence, one in Constantinople and
the other in London, were destroyed by my
orders within twenty-four hours of the
courier being kidnapped. The F.O., you see,
changed their minds about 3A and used a
special cipher. Do you know that the Bolsheviks
offered twenty-five thousand pounds
for a copy of that treaty <i>en clair</i>? The
Secretary of State has been in a perfect
agony of mind about it, for the party who
negotiated this document, with certain influential
Turks behind the scenes at the
Porte, was not an official emissary. And if
Parliament had got wind of the affair at this
stage . . .&rdquo; He broke off and whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; said Desmond, &ldquo;we must do
something for this girl Xenia. Her people
are all in prison in Russia, and now that
Tarock is dead . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s already seen to,&rdquo; replied the big
man. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Xenia is being cared
for by some friends of mine, and in a little
while, when she has got over this shock, I
think I ought to be able to utilize her knowledge
of Russian at one of our report centres
in the Baltic States. In any case, I mean
to remove her as soon as possible out of
Clubfoot&rsquo;s reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s vanished into thin air, I suppose?&rdquo;
Desmond remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect Vidocq!&rdquo; the Chief observed.
&ldquo;But never fear: he&rsquo;ll be after us again,
if only to pay us back for checkmating him
this time!&rdquo; And he grinned with great contentment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s our next move to be, sir?&rdquo;
asked Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and that brother of yours,&rdquo; replied
the Chief, &ldquo;will, each and severally, equip
yourselves with a bag of golf-clubs and report
to-morrow morning at a course not too
far removed from London and devote yourselves,
until further orders, to reducing your
respective handicaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Clubfoot . . .&rdquo; the two young
men broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clubfoot will keep. But you&rsquo;ll not beat
him with your nerves frayed out at the ends.
You two get out into the fresh air and forget
all about him. And in the mean time . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luncheon is served,&rdquo; announced Desmond&rsquo;s
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good an occupation as any,&rdquo; observed
the Chief, &ldquo;in the intervals between the
rounds!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GIRL AT THE HEXAGON</span></h2>
<p>That the Okewoods obeyed the Chief&rsquo;s
instructions to the letter I can testify,
for I happened to be drinking my after-luncheon
in the lounge of the hotel at Broadstairs
when they arrived with suitcases and golf-bags.
Desmond was wearing a bandage
about his head, and, after we had exchanged
greetings, I asked him what he had been
doing to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a crack on the head from a ball
playing racquets at Queen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; unblushingly
replied this master of improvisation, &ldquo;and so
I&rsquo;ve decided to revert to golf. We think
it&rsquo;s less dangerous, don&rsquo;t we, Francis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; rejoined his brother, who likes to
flavour his speech at times with certain exoticisms
acquired from his American wife, &ldquo;but
a heap less exciting, eh, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>At this time, naturally, I had no idea of
the hidden meaning of these seemingly innocent
remarks. There was certainly nothing
to suggest their secret significance in the
blandly smiling countenances of the two
brothers. That is the Okewood pair all over.
Their team-work is wonderful. They always
remind me of two acrobats on a trapeze:
one is invariably there when he is required
to catch or support the other. I can
imagine no more devastating combination
than these two quiet but supremely competent
young men on any mission requiring a blend
of excessive tact and sublime audacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you down here for long?&rdquo; Desmond
asked me.</p>
<p>I told him I expected to stay for a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;That means
there&rsquo;ll always be a partner for Francis or
me when we&rsquo;re sick of playing against each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I replied,
indignant at such shameless opportunism.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come down here to finish a book. I&rsquo;m
not in the War Office, you know: I have to
work for <i>my</i> living.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Industrious Apprentice Rebukes
His Idle Companion,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Francis.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s being smug, Des. Let&rsquo;s sit on his
head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation degenerated into a most
undignified wrestling match, which ended,
after I had been nearly smothered by a
cushion, by my consenting, as a rare and
notable exception, to accompany them forthwith
to the North Foreland for a three-ball
match before tea.</p>
<p>Looking back, I find it hard to realize that
my light-hearted and amusing companions
on that blustery February afternoon were
living under a grave and terrible menace.
Even now I can scarcely bring myself to
believe that Desmond, as debonair, as bright
and as sparkling as ever, had only just
emerged from such nerve-racking experiences
as the affair of the purple cabriolet
and the case of the Constantinople courier.
Now that I come to think of it, I remarked
that his nervous air which had attracted the
attention of old Erasmus Wilkes had completely
vanished. I can well believe Francis
when he says that the one thing his brother
cannot stand is inaction and that danger is
his best tonic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>In the upshot it proved that my two
friends could get on very well without me.
For the best part of four weeks I was left in
peace with my writing, and very often I did
not see the Okewoods until the evening when
we usually assembled in the bar for a cocktail
before dinner. If I had not been so absorbed
in my book, I should probably have noticed
that Desmond appeared to benefit very little
by his change. As it was, it was not until
my bulky parcel of manuscript had been
posted off to London and I accompanied them
to the golf-course for a round before lunch
that I observed how quiet and abstracted
Desmond had become.</p>
<p>I chaffed him mildly on his low spirits;
but he did not, as usual, take up the challenge
and my jokes fell flat. He was playing very
badly on this morning and, usually a strong
and accurate driver, was slicing and pulling
his balls all over the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>We were on the tee near the Captain Digby
public-house when a telegraph boy appeared
from nowhere, as telegraph boys do, and
thrust a telegram into my hand. Absent-mindedly
I opened it and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dine with me at Hexagon Saturday night
eight <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Chief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a glance I realized that the message was
not for me and, looking at the envelope, saw
that it was addressed to &ldquo;Major Desmond
Okewood.&rdquo; With a word of apology I handed
the telegram to my friend. The change in
his face, as he read it, was extraordinary. A
long sigh, almost a groan, of relief burst
from his lips and his whole face lighted up.
He showed the message to Francis, who
grinned cheerfully and said &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; cried Desmond, suddenly addressing
me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your honour. I lay you
a new ball I take this hole off you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Needless to say, for my thoughts were
anywhere but on the game, I foozled my
drive. But Desmond who, as I have said,
had been playing disgracefully, hit a perfect
ball, and, from that moment on, recovered
his form. He was in the wildest spirits, and
to see him one would have said that the telegram
which had wrought this astonishing
change in him had brought him news of a
great inheritance rather than a banal invitation
to dinner at that rather disreputable
West-End haunt, the Hexagon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>But even if he had known to what perilous
enterprise that invitation was the prelude,
I believe he would have shown himself no less
heartened. Danger, as Francis says, was
ever the best pick-me-up for Desmond Okewood.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Okewood,&rdquo; said the Chief quietly, &ldquo;the
girl has just come in. Don&rsquo;t look up for a
moment! She&rsquo;s taken the table next to the
door: in black she is: you can&rsquo;t mistake her,
she&rsquo;s so deathly pale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief fell to studying his plate with
every appearance of absorption, while Desmond
Okewood, from behind the cover of
the wine-list, glanced casually across the
roaring evening life of the Hexagon Buffet.</p>
<p>He saw the girl at once. Her extreme
pallor, as the Chief had been quick to note,
was her most distinctive feature. She wore
her hair, which was raven-black, piled high
in the Spanish fashion with a tall, white ivory
comb, richly carved, at the back. She had
retained her fur coat and against its shaggy
blackness one white shoulder gleamed milkily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>She was obviously a familiar visitor at the
Hexagon Buffet, for the head waiter greeted
her with a friendly smile as he fussed the
table to rights. She ordered her dinner composedly
and without hesitation, as one accustomed
to fend for herself. In her whole
comportment there was an air of dignity, of
reserve, which clearly imposed itself on the
<i>maitre d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</i>, accustomed as he was to the
rather promiscuous familiarity of the other
unaccompanied ladies who frequented the
Buffet. Her orders given, the girl dropped
her eyes to her plate and remained seemingly
lost in thought, her long lashes resting like
black crescents upon her dead-white cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite the style of the Hexagon, eh?&rdquo;
remarked Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They get all sorts here now!&rdquo; retorted
his companion. &ldquo;The old Hexagon is quite
the rage again, I&rsquo;m told!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Fashion, always capricious, is never more
fickle than in the distribution of her favours
among those who cater for the <i>monde ou l&rsquo;on
s&rsquo;amuse</i>. For no apparent reason a grill-room,
a bar, a night-club, or the like will
suddenly receive from the hand of the goddess
the patent that confers fame. It lives its
little hour; for a spell it resounds to laughter
and music, the popping of corks, and the
scurry of waiters, while the shareholders
bask in the warmth of unwonted prosperity
like a cat in the sun. Then as mysteriously,
but also as suddenly as success, decline sets
in: the nightly line of private cars and taxis
outside the brilliantly lighted portico dwindles:
the gold lace on the porter&rsquo;s cap begins
to tarnish; and ultimately provincials, to
whose ears the fame of the resort has only
tardily come, find themselves facing fellow
provincials across a vista of empty tables.</p>
<p>Sometimes the wheel turns full circle and
popularity comes back. So it had gone with
the Hexagon Buffet. Time was, in the days
of the &ldquo;Crutch and Toothpick Brigade,&rdquo;
when it had rivalled &ldquo;Jimmie&rsquo;s&rdquo; as the haunt
of the <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> in their skin-tight
clothes, their opera-capes, and their covert-coats.
Then oblivion had slowly claimed it
and, in the years between, the riff-raff of the
West End had gathered nightly at the long
bar with the battered brass rail where once
the chappies had stood and chaffed &ldquo;Maudie&rdquo;
and &ldquo;May&rdquo; over a &ldquo;B. and S.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>But now, in the fullness of time, prosperity
had returned to the &ldquo;old Hex.&rdquo; The fine
proportions of its big central room left ample
space for a dancing-floor between the long
bar at one end and the railed-off enclosure at
the other where one dined or supped. A
jazz band of negroes and an expatriated
mixer who, when America knew not Volstead,
had enjoyed continental fame, showed
that the Hexagon had adapted itself to the
spirit of the age.</p>
<p>Custom flowed back. It was as though the
trainers and the jockeys and the bookmakers,
the fighting-men and their managers, their
impresarii and tame journalists, had suddenly
remembered the old Hexagon. At their
heels came the wealthy patrons of sport, the
older men at first, drawn by memories fast
fading of wild nights in the eighties, then the
young &ldquo;knuts,&rdquo; and with them, to dance a
little and eat devilled bones after the theatre,
chorus ladies, revue girls, and females, unattached
or attached, of varying ages and
social standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>But mingling with this heterogeneous
crowd were old frequenters of the Hexagon
in its evil days, mysterious &ldquo;financiers,&rdquo; confidence
trick men with their touts and runners,
slim Latins, with hair like blue satin
and the gait of a panther, from the dancing-clubs,
and benevolent-looking old ladies, a
little too freshly complexioned and a little
too bejewelled, who take an interest in any
girl that is young and pretty. In brief, the
Hexagon was pre&euml;minently a resort where
the head of a Secret Service organization, to
say nothing of one of his principal lieutenants,
might expect to make fruitful observations.</p>
<p>It was Saturday night and the Hexagon
was roaring full. On the dancing-floor,
crowded with gliding couples, the red-coated
blacks were syncopating themselves into an
epileptic frenzy; at the long bar, whence resounded
the rattle of the cocktail-shakers, the
white-coated attendants were opening oysters
as though their lives depended on it; while
at the far end of the room, waiters darted
incessantly between the thronged tables.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Through the long violet curtains that
screened the Buffet from the outer lobby new
arrivals kept appearing, men and women, old
and young, in evening dress and in tweeds,
in ermine-collared opera-cloaks and in tailor-mades.
And from the merry, noisy, busy,
jostling assembly rose, as persistently as the
swathes of blue tobacco smoke that drifted
aloft on the overheated air, a confused
Babel of voices as incessant as the hum of
a threshing-floor or the pounding of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name,&rdquo; said the Chief suddenly, as
though he divined his companion&rsquo;s thoughts,
&ldquo;or at any rate the name by which she chooses
to be known, is Madeleine McKenzie. She
has been coming here now for a week or
more. Nobody knows much about her.
Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nudged Desmond&rsquo;s elbow. Two youths,
very sleek and impeccably attired in evening
dress, had sat down at the girl&rsquo;s table. One
of them, a fair-haired, clean-looking boy, was
slightly merry with wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&rdquo;&mdash;unexpectedly the Chief&rsquo;s
voice had become grave&mdash;&ldquo;watch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>His tone quickened Desmond&rsquo;s whole attention.
Ever since the Chief had asked him
to dine at the Hexagon on this particular
Saturday night, he had been cudgelling his
brains to discover with what motive his
senior officer had wished to entertain him at
this amusing but very bohemian night-resort.
Over their Clover Club cocktails at the bar
and on various pretexts during dinner itself,
Desmond had sought in vain to probe the
depths of his host&rsquo;s thoughts. Now came
this summons to watchfulness, stirring in
the young man that hunger for adventure
which had carried him to such heights of
success in the Secret Service.</p>
<p>The girl had finished her dinner and was
taking her coffee when a woman with a
basket of flowers approached the table. Desmond
had remarked the flower-seller during
the evening, a rather sinister-looking person
in black with neat lace apron and cuffs, plying
her wares at the bar and among the diners.
She stopped in front of the girl and her two
companions and, resting her basket on her
hip, took from it a little nosegay and laid it
silently upon the girl&rsquo;s plate. The girl smiled
and pinned the flowers to the lapel of her fur
coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the flowers?&rdquo; said the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, did you notice what flowers they
were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond glanced across the room. &ldquo;They
seem to be a white carnation with some sort
of blue flowers&mdash;cornflowers, probably&mdash;set
round it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; mused the other. &ldquo;Then I think
we can be moving, Okewood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave the charming and mysterious
Madeleine here?&rdquo; queried Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the older man, signing to a
waiter, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s going too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth
when the girl rose up from her table by the
door, gathering her heavy coat about her.
It was quite obvious that the young men were
seeking to detain her. But laughingly she
put them off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night!&rdquo; they heard her say as a
sudden lull came in the music. &ldquo;I shall see
you here again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, without looking to left or right, she
hurried from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DECOY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Okewood,&rdquo; opened the Chief
when, half an hour later, he faced
Desmond across the fireside in his library,
&ldquo;you find me grappling with what is probably
the most perplexing problem I have ever
tackled. For the past four weeks, since your
very ugly adventure with our old friend Clubfoot
in the affair of the Constantinople
courier, I have kept you and your brother
deliberately away from the Service . . .
against your own wish, I know . . .
frankly because you are too valuable to be
sacrificed to Dr. Grundt&rsquo;s personal spite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of the name of his old
enemy, Desmond Okewood sat up eagerly in
his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Clubfoot up to his tricks again?&rdquo; he
asked quickly.</p>
<p>The Chief shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I used
to have the reputation of being a man who
knew his own mind,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Desmond looked at the beaklike nose and
the massive jaw appraisingly. The Chief was
worshipped in the Service for his quickness
of decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when I tell you, in answer to your
question, that one day I think he is and the
next day I think he isn&rsquo;t, you will realize how
badly they&rsquo;ve got me bothered. It&rsquo;s not a
long story, Okewood, and you may as well
hear it because, I tell you honestly, the thing&rsquo;s
got too big for one man to handle alone;
I ought to give the whole of my attention to
it, but I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m too busy. If I did, I
should have to neglect other more important
affairs, and that is precisely what this campaign
of deviltry is meant to achieve.&rdquo; The
Chief drew meditatively on his cigar. &ldquo;You
knew Finucane, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was lately in Brussels for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather. But why &lsquo;knew&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s vanished, Okewood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnapped or . . .?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered, almost certainly. It&rsquo;s more
than a week since it happened. He knew too
much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Desmond nodded his assent. Brussels, the
half-way house to everywhere in Europe, is
the report centre for the espionage services
of every great European Power. The Secret
Service agent who can make good in Brussels
has little left to learn about the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday a week ago Finucane crossed
over from Brussels to see me,&rdquo; the Chief
resumed. &ldquo;Between ourselves, Finucane has
been tightening up our report centres in
industrial Germany. You know Finucane,
Okewood: no Vere de Vere about him, but a
devilish clever fellow and a damned judgmatical
briber. His reports on the German
situation have been admirable, and the Prime
Minister was delighted. Finucane came over
to get his head patted and also to submit
certain plans for the development of our
arrangements in Germany.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Finucane got in from Brussels on Friday
evening by the train that reaches Victoria
at nine-twenty-five. He was to see me on
the following morning. He engaged a room
at the Nineveh, changed into evening dress,
and went off to get a bite to eat and see
life at the Hexagon. At five minutes to
midnight he left the Hexagon alone and apparently
perfectly sober. He never reached
his hotel and has neither been seen nor heard
of since!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond whistled. &ldquo;Did he have the
goods on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief laughed dryly. &ldquo;Not Finucane!
He carried it all under his hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got no trace of him, no clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhere in the house an electric bell
trilled. The Chief looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as we know the last person to
speak to Finucane before he disappeared was
Madeleine McKenzie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By a fortunate
coincidence there happened to be present
at the Hexagon that night a young detective
from Vine Street named Rimmer, who was
keeping observation on a gang of West-End
crooks. This bright young man remembers
Finucane perfectly. Apparently Finucane
spoke to the girl and, sitting down at her
table, ordered a bottle of champagne. The
McKenzie girl left first and Finucane remained
to finish the bottle. Just before midnight
he paid the bill and went away. The
curious thing is that, while Finucane and the
girl were drinking together at the table, the
flower-woman approached, just as she did to-night,
and gave the girl a bunch of flowers.
And, again, just as we saw this evening, on
receiving the nosegay the girl promptly left
the place . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;A signal, eh?&rdquo; queried Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;But what
does it portend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened. Watkyn, the Chief&rsquo;s
butler, a massively built ex-petty officer,
with a pair of shoulders like an ox, was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Elliott!&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Elliott can tell us!&rdquo; remarked
the great man as the butler ushered into the
library that selfsame youth whom, slightly
merry with wine, they had seen but half an
hour ago at Madeleine McKenzie&rsquo;s table at
the Hexagon.</p>
<p>The Chief wasted no time on introductions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; was his greeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;We carried out your instructions to the
letter, sir,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very
ladylike, attractive girl, not a bit the sort
of skirt you meet knockin&rsquo; about places like
the &lsquo;old Hex.&rsquo; I pressed her very hard to
let me drive her home, and I really thought
I was getting on with her pretty well. But
all of a sudden she kind of dried up and said
she had to go . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo; snapped the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, &lsquo;when&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what stage of your conversation, with
the lady did this change come over her?&rdquo;
said the Chief testily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! after she was given some flowers by
old Bessie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief nodded grimly. &ldquo;Well, and
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We followed her taxi. She went home
to Duchess Street. I left Robin to keep
watch and follow her if she should leave the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Chief nodded. &ldquo;Thank you,
Peter,&rdquo; he remarked, more gently this time.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all for to-night. You can pick
Robin up on your way home and send him to
bed. And hark&rsquo;ee, the pair of you steer clear
of the Hexagon until further orders, do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;Good-night,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the door had closed on him the Chief
turned to Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We took a statement from the girl. Her
story absolutely tallies with Rimmer&rsquo;s. She
had a touch of neuralgia, she says, and went
home early that night. She lives in furnished
rooms in a most respectable house
near the Langham Hotel, and if she is what
she seems to be, she certainly does not ply
her trade there. And yet what is the mystery
of these flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she asked about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief shook his head. &ldquo;I was afraid
of raising her suspicions. If it is a code a
question like that would make them change
it. But three times this week I&rsquo;ve despatched
some of my people to the Hexagon to get into
conversation with the girl, different types
each time, and I&rsquo;ve got only negative results.
The first man I sent posed as a rich Colonial
newly landed in London, exactly the sort of
fish that the West-End crooks and their decoys
are always trying to land. She let him
buy her a drink; Bessie, the flower-woman,
came across in due course and gave her a
bunch of white carnations, and presently she
made an excuse to join a party at another
table. But&mdash;note this well!&mdash;she did not
leave the place until closing time, when she
took a taxi home alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two nights later I sent another fellow
along. His orders were to sit in the girl&rsquo;s
line of vision, but on no account to address
her first. Nothing happened. She made
no advances to him; nobody else spoke to her,
and she received no flowers. She stayed
until closing time and again drove away to
Duchess Street by herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night, by my instructions, young Elliott
took her on. As when Finucane was
with her, she received, as you saw, a nosegay,
not of white flowers only as my Colonial got,
but of white flowers mingled with blue.
Forthwith she drops young Peter and his
friend and goes home. Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; observed his companion.
&ldquo;It would help us enormously if we knew
what flowers she was given the night that
Finucane disappeared!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;I agree. But Rimmer didn&rsquo;t notice. We
could have cross-examined old Bessie; but
if this is a code, she&rsquo;s certainly in it too; and
I will <i>not</i> scare them off it until I see more
clearly . . .&rdquo; He paused and, ticking each
point off on his fingers, resumed presently:
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a code, this is what I make of it.
General instructions to the girl: sit around
at the &lsquo;Hex.&rsquo; every night, make no advances,
but only receive them. A white flower
means, &lsquo;Drop the fellow; he does not interest
us, but stand by&rsquo;; a white and a blue say:
&lsquo;The fellow does not interest us; you can
go home.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; commented Desmond, enthusiasm
in his voice, &ldquo;this is getting jolly
interesting, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed the Chief. &ldquo;But where
does it take us? Up against a blank wall.
And meanwhile Finucane&rsquo;s disappearance remains
a mystery, and the <i>morale</i> of my staff
is being ruined! This negative result business
leads nowhere. I want something positive
to show whether Madeleine McKenzie is or
is not at the bottom of this baffling affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about old Bessie? Who gives <i>her</i>
her orders?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve drawn blank there, too! My men
are in the crowd at the &lsquo;Hex.&rsquo; every night
to watch the old strap. Fellows often buy
flowers from her for ladies at the &lsquo;Hex.,&rsquo;
but, as far as my young men have been able
to see, no one has sent any flowers to Madeleine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond was silent for a moment. &ldquo;In
that case,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;there is only
one way of finding out whether the young
woman is being used as a decoy; that is, to
send her some one prominent, a really big
fish, and let her employers know, if possible,
that he&rsquo;s coming. We shadow our decoy
and see where he leads us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief chuckled delightedly. &ldquo;What I
like about you, Okewood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that
your instincts are so unerring. You have
hit precisely upon my plan. Listen! There
is at present working for me in Germany a
gentleman who is commonly known in this
office as Murchison of Munich, you have
never met him, for he is a recent acquisition,
a banker by profession and a first-rate economist
with a natural ability for Intelligence
work. For the last eight weeks he has been
in southern Germany carrying out an investigation
into the transfer of German wealth
abroad. I flatter myself that we have been
able to cover up his tracks so successfully
that, in his capacity as secret agent, he is
actually known by sight to myself alone. Do
you follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Desmond nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the Chief continued, &ldquo;the important thing
about his mission, from the standpoint
of our present dilemma, is that the big
German industrialists have lately become
aware of the presence of one of my fellows
in the inner ring of their councils without,
however, being able to identify him. I am
virtually certain that the kidnapping of Finucane
(to whom Murchison&mdash;did I tell you?&mdash;has
been reporting) was intended as a
warning to me that they are on the alert. A
word to a certain &lsquo;double-cross&rsquo; of my acquaintance
giving away the identity of Murchison
of Munich, and a hint dropped in the
same quarter that, on a certain evening, the
party in question is to be found at the Hexagon,
will infallibly bring Clubfoot into the
open again . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clubfoot? Why Clubfoot?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the Chief gravely, &ldquo;our
crippled friend, Dr. Grundt, the redoubtable
master spy of Imperial Germany, has transferred
his allegiance to the German industrialist
ring, which, as you know, is the heart
and soul of the great conspiracy to restore
the fortunes of Germany as a militarist monarchy.
Grundt to-day is the instrument of
the coal and steel bosses, the real masters of
modern Germany . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been working for them ever since
his reappearance, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. Now, see here again. If,
when Murchison appears at the Hexagon,
Madeleine McKenzie is used as the decoy, we
shall have acquired the certainty that it was
she who lured Finucane away. And if subsequent
developments don&rsquo;t lead us back to
old Clubfoot, damn it, I&rsquo;ll eat my hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing your surmise does not
prove correct,&rdquo; Desmond objected, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
have given away one of your best men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief smiled and shook his head.
&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t! Murchison of Munich is
going to stay quietly where he is in South
Germany . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>The eyes of the two men met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear in mind,&rdquo; added the Chief, &ldquo;that
nobody has ever seen Murchison of Munich
except myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a significant pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I do so hate painting my face!&rdquo; remarked
Desmond irrelevantly.</p>
<p>The Chief laughed. &ldquo;I knew I could count
on you, Okewood. Very little disguise will
be necessary if you will consent to sacrifice
your moustache. All I ask you to do is to
dine at the Hexagon at eight o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
evening in the guise of Mr. Murchison
of Munich. You can leave the rest to me.
And if, in the course of the evening, you
should recognize that brother of yours&mdash;well,
don&rsquo;t! Now as to this question of your
make-up . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE HOUSE IN PIMLICO</span></h2>
<p>At five minutes to eight on the following
evening, Desmond Okewood took his
seat at the table which had been reserved for
Mr. Murchison at the Hexagon. Next to the
door, two tables away, the McKenzie girl
was seated, eating her dinner with the air of
quiet simplicity that Desmond had already
remarked in her. She was again in black,
but the Spanish comb was gone, and she now,
wore a smart little black hat whose curving
brim and sweeping black aigrette emphasized
the rather wistful piquancy of her features.
Desmond fancied he could detect about her
a vague air of excitement, of expectancy.
At any rate, there was a faint glow of colour,
in her pale cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Desmond Okewood was feeling particularly
pleased with himself. I, who had
known him all his life, came in with a party
and passed him by without recognizing him,
as he told me gleefully afterwards. And yet,
as the Chief had said, very little disguise had
proved necessary. With grease-paint and
powder Desmond had blocked the healthy
tan out of his face, a touch of rouge on the
cheek-bones had altered the set of his features,
and a subtle change had been wrought
in the expression of his eyes by the simple
process of shaving off the outer corner of the
eye-brows and correcting their line with a
black pencil. The sacrifice of his moustache
and the addition of a pair of horn-rimmed
spectacles had sufficed to achieve the Chief&rsquo;s
object, which was to render Desmond&rsquo;s
general appearance both nondescript and negligible.</p>
<p>Suddenly the young man felt a little tingle
of excitement. Bessie, the flower-woman,
whom he had noticed offering her wares
among the serried ranks of loungers at the
long bar, was crossing the room. A man
at a table on the edge of the dancing-floor
bought a bunch of violets for the girl with
him. A nasty-looking old woman, Desmond
decided, as Bessie approached, with small
eyes, dull and lifeless, and thin lips set in a
fixed, unmeaning smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>She passed him by and stopped at the McKenzie
girl&rsquo;s table. From her basket rested
on the white damask she took a cluster of
deep red carnations and laid them silently,
with her eternal smirk, beside the girl&rsquo;s plate.
No word was exchanged between them; with
a grateful smile at the woman the girl pinned
the flowers in the front of her dress and
Bessie passed on.</p>
<p>Desmond waited. Excitement had dulled
the edge of his appetite, and he made a pretext
of eating while he narrowly watched
the girl. Once or twice he caught her glancing
archly at him from under her heavy black
lashes, and now, as he looked at her, she let
her dark eyes rest invitingly on his.</p>
<p>He beckoned to the waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask the lady in black by the door whether
I may offer her a glass of champagne,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The man nodded understandingly, and the
next moment Desmond was facing Madeleine
McKenzie across the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Her complete self-possession was the first
thing that struck him, for she was obviously
quite young. She was not coy about the
informality of their meeting, and she received
his introductory banalities about the crowd
and the band and the food with an air of
amused indifference which piqued him.</p>
<p>She made him talk about himself, parrying
with skill all his efforts to draw her out.
Little by little, so sure and sympathetic was
her touch, Desmond found himself entering
into the spirit of his part, talking of the life
of Munich, the Opera, the little <i>th&eacute;&acirc;tres intimes</i>,
the huge, noisy <i>brasseries</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are used to a life of excitement,
then?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It was Desmond&rsquo;s cue. Swiftly he took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
only a few hours in London, and I&rsquo;m sick of
it already. Does any one ever have a good
time here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl flashed a glance at him from under
her long lashes. &ldquo;If you know where to
look for it,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you know your way around,&rdquo; Desmond
replied.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders prettily. &ldquo;My
ideas of a good time might not agree with
yours,&rdquo; she countered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are your ideas of a good time?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>She sighed. &ldquo;Gambling!&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;if I could afford it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond grew alert on the instant. Was
this the secret of Finucane&rsquo;s disappearance,
cleaned out in a <i>tripot</i> and ashamed to show
his face again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking,&rdquo; he said. He lowered
his voice. &ldquo;Tell me, do you know where
there&rsquo;s a game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scrutinized his face, turned up to
hers. &ldquo;If I thought you were to be
trusted . . .&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;If you think
I&rsquo;m a police spy! However, I dare say I can
find my own way to the roulibouli!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve offended you,&rdquo; she said, and
laid her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Are you really
keen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keen? Gambling&rsquo;s the only sort of excitement
worth while, and I&rsquo;ve tried most
sorts. The shaded lights, the green cloth,
the click of the ball, the scrape of the rakes&mdash;the
night should have four and twenty hours
if I had my way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come closer!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Leave me
here and drive to the clock outside Victoria
Station at the entrance to the Vauxhall
Bridge Road. Wait for me there. I mustn&rsquo;t
be seen leaving with you. The police watch
the Hexagon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crucial moment had arrived. Desmond
glanced quickly round the room.
There was no sign of Francis or any of the
Chief&rsquo;s men. Well, his orders were to go
through with the adventure. He paid the bill
and left the girl at her table. Half an hour
later, as he waited in front of the clock-tower
at Victoria, a taxi drew up and a white hand
tapped softly on the glass.</p>
<p class="tb">The girl stopped the cab in front of one of
those tall, gloomy houses that face the river
in Grosvenor Road. Behind them, over an
arch of lights, the trams thumped across
Vauxhall Bridge; before them, beyond a
wilderness of warehouses and wharves, the
glow of South London shone luridly in the
night sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The house was dark and, save for the taxi
quietly chugging at the door, the street was
deserted. The girl jumped out first and, a
latchkey in her hand, was already at the
front door as Desmond alighted. For an
instant he hesitated. What had happened
to Francis and the others? Had the Chief
failed him? Should he go on? His orders
left him no choice. He had to play his part
and leave the rest to the Chief. He felt in
his jacket pocket for the reassuring chill of
his automatic as he turned to pay the cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; he asked the driver, an
apple-cheeked greybeard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s gone wrong, Des.,&rdquo; replied
the man in a low voice, the voice of Francis
Okewood. &ldquo;The Chief&rsquo;s people were to have
followed us. Back out of this while you
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the top of the steps the girl was
signalling to Desmond to make haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you change for a ten-shilling
note?&rdquo; Desmond said aloud to his brother,
and added in an undertone: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
see it through. But get help quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he followed the girl into
the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>They crossed the hall, a dingy place in
which a gas-jet in a stained-glass lamp
burned dimly. The girl stopped at a door
at the end and, producing another key, unlocked
it. They entered another lobby, very
spick and span with its white paint and red
Wilton pile carpet and brilliantly lighted. The
murmur of voices came from swing-doors
that led off it and the air was heavy with the
fragrant aroma of cigars.</p>
<p>At the end of the lobby, with their backs
to the entrance door, a man and a girl stood.
The man had his arms about the woman
and his face was buried in the aureole of her
golden hair. Desmond heard a sharp exclamation
from Madeleine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul!&rdquo; she cried sharply.</p>
<p>The couple sprang apart. Like a fury
Madeleine turned on the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with my husband?&rdquo;
she demanded, and advanced menacingly
towards her, her eyes blazing with anger
and her thin hands shaking. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mine,
you . . . you painted slut!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>The woman gave a cry of terror and bolted
through the door into the adjacent room.
Madeleine would have followed her, but
the man stepped between them and seized
the girl by the wrists. He was a big, showy
fellow, in the forties, in evening dress, very
well groomed, with sleek dark hair and a
dark moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that, d&rsquo;you hear?&rdquo; he commanded.
He spoke with a marked foreign accent.</p>
<p>Furiously the girl wrenched herself free,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of it all!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Sick of
being trifled with. Do you understand?
Haven&rsquo;t I lowered myself to the dirt for
you? Haven&rsquo;t I acted the part of a common
prostitute to help you, and this is all the
reward I get? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked apprehensively at Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he said to Madeleine in a
voice that was intended to be persuasive;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t make a scene in front of our friend
here! It was&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;only a joke of mine&mdash;to
make you jealous, little woman . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lies, lies, always lies!&rdquo; the girl burst
in. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m through with you now. Do
you understand? You&rsquo;re welcome to your
Lotties and your Nancys and your painted
French women! I do no more dirty work
for you after this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bit his moustache. His eyes
were very evil. He controlled himself with
an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dirty work?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What a horrid
word, Mado! Come, now, take your cloak
off! I&rsquo;m sure our friend wants a
game . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl would not be pacified. &ldquo;Horrid
word, is it? Then what became of the
other I brought here for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face darkened horribly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. Do you hear?&rdquo; he cried,
and clapped his hand over the girl&rsquo;s mouth.
But, with a fierce effort wrenching herself
free: &ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo; she cried to Desmond.
&ldquo;For the love of God, get out of this house!
If you don&rsquo;t . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>But her voice died away on a stifled
scream. Two men in evening dress had suddenly
appeared, and, lifting her bodily up,
bore her struggling away up a stair that
curved upward from the end of the hall.
Desmond, springing instinctively forward to
her aid, found his way blocked by Paul. Behind
him, in the doorway leading off the
vestibule, against a background of dim green
light, sullen and forbidding faces now
scowled. And a burly, thick-set man in a
dinner coat, with a broken nose, had quietly
posted himself between Desmond and the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss McKenzie,&rdquo; said Paul suavely, &ldquo;is
subject to these <i>crises de nerfs</i>. I must
apologize for the disturbance, Mr. . . .
Mr. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murchison!&rdquo; said Desmond abstractedly.</p>
<p>He was wondering whether he had
alarmed himself unnecessarily. It was not
the first time he had been in a London gaming-hell,
and the curious muted hush beneath
the green-shaded lamps of the room off the
lobby was as familiar to him as the dim
figures he could descry about the table
watching with painful intensity the measured
movements of the banker as he drew the
cards from the shoe. Perhaps the scene he
had just witnessed was merely one of the
habitual encounters between a bully and his
victims.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Yet the girl&rsquo;s warning had obviously been
sincere. Who was &ldquo;the other&rdquo; of whom she
had spoken? Finucane? . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Geyer,&rdquo; the man Paul was
saying. &ldquo;Felix, take the gentleman&rsquo;s coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, with a gesture of odious
familiarity, he clapped his arm about the
young man. Before Desmond realized what
he was up to, Paul had drawn from the
other&rsquo;s jacket pocket the automatic pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rule
of the house!&rdquo; And he handed it to the man
he had called Felix.</p>
<p>With a sinking heart, for now he knew he
had the worst to fear, Desmond silently
followed his mentor through the swing-doors.</p>
<p class="tb">An air of expectancy rested over the card-room.
The atmosphere was warm and so
thick with the fumes of tobacco that at first
Desmond was conscious only of a sea of
white faces turned towards the door. The
throng about the table parted to make way
for him as Paul Geyer led him up to the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;A new member of our circle, my
friends,&rdquo; Geyer&rsquo;s voice trumpeted triumphantly
through the room; &ldquo;a desperate gambler
who loves the green cloth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood between Desmond and the table,
his hands very white in the pool of light shed
by the low-hung, shaded lamps. He stepped
aside.</p>
<p>Desmond found himself facing The Man
with the Clubfoot.</p>
<p>Grundt was holding the bank. His great
hairy hands were spread out on the table,
one resting on the <i>sabot</i>, the other with its
knotted fingers sprawling over swathes of
shining playing-cards. His vast torso was
leant back in his chair and his red and fleshy
lips drew noisily on a glowing cigar held
securely between his strong, yellow teeth.
Beneath their shaggy, tufted brows his dark
eyes flamed defiance, insolence, triumph;
indeed, there was an indescribable air of
arrogance about his whole attitude and demeanour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Desmond&rsquo;s first thought was Francis.
How long would he be in procuring assistance?
Help could not arrive yet awhile, for
it was not half an hour since they had parted.
Was not the immediate question rather how
long could Desmond hold Clubfoot off?</p>
<p>And then, with a sudden thrill of hope,
he remembered his disguise. Grundt would,
he knew, murder Desmond Okewood out of
hand. But might not Murchison of Munich
gain a brief respite? Yet would the disguise,
summary as it was, stand the test of those
keen and terrible eyes that even now were
searching his face?</p>
<p>There was no light in the room, Desmond
reflected with satisfaction, other than the
shaded table-lamps; and, for the present,
the features of Murchison, fully described
and circulated through the medium of the
Chief&rsquo;s &ldquo;double-cross,&rdquo; were uppermost in
Clubfoot&rsquo;s mind. But&mdash;and with a pang
the realization came to Desmond&mdash;the voice
was the great betrayer. If he must speak&mdash;and
he could not remain dumb without
arousing suspicion&mdash;disguise his voice as he
would, Grundt must inevitably recognize it.</p>
<p>But now Grundt was addressing him.
&ldquo;Herr Murchison, hein? Es freut mich
sehr! A gambler, was?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>He grunted and puffed meditatively at
his cigar. &ldquo;Gambling is a very pleasant
pursuit,&rdquo; he continued amiably. Then his
voice grew grim: &ldquo;But it has its drawbacks,
Herr Murchison. The loser pays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an effort he straightened himself up
in his chair, shook the ash from his cigar
into a tray, and leaned across the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been leaking to you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Herr Murchison&rsquo;s hands were shaking
violently. His pallid features seemed to be
distraught with sheer fright. Through his
large goggles he blinked feebly, idiotically,
at his questioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Grundt, placing one
black-thatched hand palm downwards on
the green cloth, &ldquo;your activities in South
Germany are inconvenient to me. With
your English gold you have been corrupting
my wretched compatriots, plundered and
pillaged by the rapacious French, your
allies . . .&rdquo; His fingers clawed up a
card. &ldquo;I shall crush your organization, you
and your helpers and your helpers&rsquo; helpers
. . . like that!&rdquo; The gleaming
millboard wilted in his powerful grasp.
&ldquo;Where are your headquarters?&rdquo; he rapped
out, snarling, and added over his shoulder:
&ldquo;Meinhardt, take a note of his answers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Herr Murchison cast a panic-stricken
glance round the silent, forbidding circle of
attentive faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me, you dog!&rdquo; thundered Clubfoot.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty of means at my disposal
to banish coyness! Come on! Out with
it! I&rsquo;m not going to waste my time tearing
it out of you piecemeal! Are you going to
make a clean breast of it? Yes or no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr Murchison extended two trembling
hands. &ldquo;Give me time!&rdquo; he murmured
weakly. &ldquo;I will tell you what I can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light of sudden vigilance appeared in
Clubfoot&rsquo;s eyes. The man&rsquo;s whole manner
changed on the instant. He seemed to
bristle. &ldquo;Time?&rdquo; he repeated as though to
himself. &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Geyer crossed the room and stood
behind Grundt&rsquo;s chair. Clubfoot whispered
something in his ear. Without leaving his
place, Geyer gave a muttered order to a man
at his side, who noiselessly left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Grundt took out his watch and laid it on
the table before him. &ldquo;I have exactly five
minutes to spare,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In that time I
propose to turn you inside out, my friend, or,
by God, we&rsquo;ll see what the old-fashioned
methods of cross-examination will do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moistened his lips with his tongue, like
some great beast of prey licking its chops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Shaking in every limb, Herr Murchison
opened his lips to speak. &ldquo;My headquarters
are . . . Munich!&rdquo; he said in a strained
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn your head to the right!&rdquo; shouted
Grundt suddenly. &ldquo;Turn your head, I say!
Meinhardt, Felix! Thrust him down under
the lamp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strong arms forced Herr Murchison
brutally forward until his chest rested on the
cloth. His spectacles fell off. The bright
light streamed full in his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Desmond Okewood, bei Gott!&rdquo; roared
Grundt. &ldquo;You poor fool, did you think
you could hoodwink me? Don&rsquo;t you know
that a man can never disguise his ears?
Himmelkreuzsakrament, you and I have a
long account to settle, and this time&rdquo;&mdash;his
voice shook with concentrated fury&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to see that it&rsquo;s paid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came a hoarse shout from without:
&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; and the sounds of a violent
scuffle. Immediately the room was a mass
of scrambling, jostling figures. The light
went out almost simultaneously . . . at
the very moment that Clubfoot clawed a
great automatic from his pocket. In the
clammy, noisy darkness Desmond flung himself
across the table straight at the throat of
that sinister gigantic figure facing him.</p>
<p>His opponent struggled fiercely, but the
chair impeded him. Desmond hung on
grimly, determined that, this time, his old
enemy should not escape him. Then the
light went up and Desmond found himself
looking into the mocking face of Paul Geyer.
Two uniformed constables pounced upon
him, and Desmond relaxed his grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the law on you,&rdquo; gasped Geyer,
tugging at his torn collar. &ldquo;Though I do
keep a table, that&rsquo;s no justification for half
murdering me! Take his name and address,
Inspector!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Touching his cap, the Inspector drew Desmond
Okewood aside. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be Major
Okewood, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your
brother has been like a wild man about you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a passage under the road to a
wharf beside the river,&rdquo; the Inspector
answered. &ldquo;It connects with the house here
by a trap in the back hall. There&rsquo;s a lame
man escaped that way . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lame man?&rdquo; queried Desmond in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye! Mr. Okewood went after him with
a couple of my chaps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the appearance of
Francis himself, breathless and dishevelled.
Only his taximan&rsquo;s uniform remained to
recall his disguise of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s away!&rdquo; he gasped, answering his
brother&rsquo;s unspoken question. &ldquo;Vanished
into the night! The men are beating the
place for him, but those blasted wharves are
a regular rabbit warren, and it&rsquo;s as dark
as be-damned outside. Who&rsquo;s your fat
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated Geyer, who, violently protesting,
was being led away by his captors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the light went out,&rdquo; said Desmond,
&ldquo;Clubfoot changed places with him. He
knew this fellow only risked a fine for keeping
a gambling-den. It was my own fault. I
over-acted and put the old man on his guard.
Where&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappeared. We&rsquo;ll get her at Duchess
Street, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bag here? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis made a grimace. &ldquo;Nothing very
great, I&rsquo;m afraid. Some vague foreigners
and a brace of bruisers. None of Clubfoot&rsquo;s
gang, at any rate. They must have smelt
a rat, for as we were picking the lock a fellow
unexpectedly opened the front door and gave
the alarm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Desmond. &ldquo;Clubfoot
got suspicious when I asked him to give me
time, and sent this chap out to see if there
were any police around. By the way, what
happened to the Chief&rsquo;s crowd?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Francis raised his eyes to heaven. &ldquo;Somebody
will be sacrificed for this night&rsquo;s work.
Their car burst a tyre in Victoria Street and
they lost sight of my taxi. The arrangement
was, you see, that they were to follow the
girl and not you. Instead of ringing up
headquarters to report, they went careering
all over Belgravia, and when I rang up the
Chief on leaving you they hadn&rsquo;t turned up.
So we simply asked the nearest police divisional
headquarters to raid this place as a
gambling-hell. It seemed the quickest way
of getting assistance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment. Then
Desmond said: &ldquo;I must say I should like to
have known how those flower signals were
worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We pinched old Bessie to-night,&rdquo; his
brother replied, &ldquo;and she spilled the beans.
A confederate, instructed by Grundt, tipped
her off the colour by means of a handkerchief
as he stood at the bar&mdash;red, blue and
white, or white. As to the meaning of the
various colours, I think the Chief&rsquo;s diagnosis
was correct. Clubfoot apparently had found
out that Finucane was an habitu&eacute; of the
&lsquo;Hex.&rsquo; in the old days and laid this plot
to trap him. Poor Finucane! The girl got
the signal of red carnations for him, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p class="tb">A week later a tug off Charing Cross Pier
fished up in its screw the dead body of
Finucane, bound hand and foot, with a bullet
through the head. The Hexagon Buffet
knew the McKenzie girl no more. Nor did
she ever return to Duchess Street. As an old
offender, Paul Geyer was given a month&rsquo;s
imprisonment for keeping a gaming-house,
and, as an alien&mdash;he was Russian-born&mdash;recommended
for deportation. In respect of
the death of Finucane no charge was brought
against him, for want of evidence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile The Man with the Clubfoot
remained at large.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MEETING</span></h2>
<p>If, as the textbooks tell us, a successful
retirement be the greatest test of
strategy, then, indeed, Clubfoot can lay
claim to be one of the most skilful of generals
in the never-ending guerilla warfare that is
the daily life of the Secret Service. No man
can ensure himself against the surprises of
fate; but in one respect Dr. Grundt&rsquo;s foresight
was never found wanting, and that was
in the provision of a safe and inconspicuous
line of retreat. Nothing is more devastating
to the <i>moral</i> of troops of pursuit than the
knowledge that their enemy, after each successful
raid, is able to retire in safety into
ambush to select his own time for the next
sortie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>My two friends frankly recognized the
affair at the house in Pimlico as a serious
reverse. Not only had Clubfoot made away
with one of the Chief&rsquo;s most expert and
trusted agents, but he had also eluded the
trap laid for him and arranged matters so as
to leave in the hands of his pursuers not a
single accomplice against whom anything
more serious than a simple misdemeanour
could be proved. In itself the check was bad
enough, but its results were even more grave.
The long list of unexplained crimes was
beginning to sap at the <i>moral</i> of the Service:
there were resignations among the weaker
vessels whom crises of this nature invariably
expose; and even the Chief, most dogged
and equable of mortals, who had his own
private reasons for anxiety, began to look
worried.</p>
<p>It therefore redounds the more to his
credit that at this juncture, some three
weeks after Clubfoot&rsquo;s escape by river from
the house of Pimlico, the Chief should have
taken a decision that, it is safe to predict,
in any walk of life other than the Secret
Service, would have been denounced as sheer
lunatic foolhardiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Once more Grundt had vanished away into
the Ewigkeit. It was as though the vast
bulk of the master spy had dissolved into
thin air. One clue, and one clue only&mdash;and
that nothing better than a report based
on more than doubtful authority&mdash;was
forthcoming pointing to his presence in Germany.
A &ldquo;double-cross&rdquo;&mdash;one of those
versatile gentlemen who carry on espionage
for both sides&mdash;sent word that a friend of
his had seen a burly lame man whose appearance
answered the description of Clubfoot
lunching at a small caf&eacute; on one of the islands
in the Havel, the river outside Berlin. No
corroboration was obtainable and nothing
more was heard directly of the redoubtable
German until one morning the Chief found
in his mail a letter from Dr. Grundt, posted
in the West Central postal district of London,
asking for an interview.</p>
<p>This the Chief decided immediately to
grant. By the rules of the game he knew
that the meeting would be privileged. In
according it he was aware that he undertook
to allow his visitor to come and go unmolested.
Such encounters are not uncommon
in the Secret Service. The &ldquo;double-crosses&rdquo;
form, as it were, an invisible bridge between
the most inveterate adversaries and, within
the limit of strange unwritten moral laws in
this most immoral of avocations, there are
pacts and understandings that not infrequently
are laid down at meetings no whit
less bizarre than the memorable interview
between Clubfoot and the Chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>With characteristic consideration the big
man sent for my two friends and informed
them of Dr. Grundt&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s . . . it&rsquo;s incredible, sir,&rdquo; said
Desmond Okewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have the nerve,&rdquo; his brother
Francis put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clubfoot would,&rdquo; grimly observed the
Chief, and pitched a letter on the desk in
front of them. &ldquo;Read it for yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange and devious are the ways of the
Secret Service. Old hands at the game,
neither Desmond nor Francis Okewood had
been astonished on being bidden, severally
and secretly, to report at the office of Jacob
Melchizedech, commission agent, Shaftsbury
Avenue, to find the Chief installed in one
of the three modest rooms which Mr.
Melchizedech&rsquo;s place of business comprised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Bizarre folk often have the pressing need
to unbosom themselves to those who pull
the strings behind the fa&ccedil;ade of public affairs.
But the social record of some of these
mysterious gentlemen and ladies is not always
one to inspire unquestioning confidence.
So, in the first instance, a non-committal
identity and a non-committal address are but
an elementary safeguard against blackmail
and the kindred practices of the &ldquo;double-cross.&rdquo;
Seldom did the Chief, known to few
only by sight and to fewer still by name, face
the casual visitor save under the cloak of an
unrevealing identity and an accommodation
address.</p>
<p>Desmond picked up the letter and read it,
while his brother looked over his shoulder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Grundt [the bold, upright handwriting set
forth] presents his compliments to his colleague,
the Director of the British Secret Service, and
requests the favour of a personal interview at a
time and place most convenient to the latter. A
reply by return in the Agony Column of <i>The
Times</i> would oblige.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned!&rdquo; Desmond exploded
violently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely not going to receive
the fellow, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Melchizedech on my behalf,&rdquo; the
Chief retorted with a twinkle in his eye,
&ldquo;will be pleased to hear anything our friend
wishes to lay before me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be three to one, anyhow!&rdquo; muttered
Francis Okewood.</p>
<p>The Chief shook his head. &ldquo;No, we
shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he announced decisively. &ldquo;You two
will be in the farther room . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Chief,&rdquo; Desmond broke in vehemently,
&ldquo;the man will be armed. He&rsquo;s dangerous:
he stops at nothing . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always meet an adversary halfway,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;And I would remind you that
Grundt and I have never yet come face to
face. I am inordinately interested, I must
confess, in this cripple who, when he directed
the ex-Kaiser&rsquo;s personal secret service, exercised
such power over his Imperial master
that he was the most dreaded man in Germany.
You and your brother have told me
so much about his dominating personality. I
like encountering dominating personalities!&rdquo;
he added reflectively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Desmond and Francis Okewood exchanged
a glance full of meaning. For
months the figure of the gigantic cripple had
haunted their thoughts. So deeply had
their long duel with The Man with the Clubfoot
impressed his figure on their brain that
in their mind&rsquo;s eye they could see him now, a
simian silhouette with his vast girth, his immensely
long arms, his leering, savage eyes
beneath the shaggy brows&mdash;above all, his inevitable
undisguisable trade-mark, the monstrous deformed foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you would meet anything or anybody
with your bare fists, sir,&rdquo; Desmond
pleaded, &ldquo;but Clubfoot is beyond the pale.
He has the profoundest contempt for our
English notions of fair play and, though you
may agree to this idea of his of an armistice
meeting, on <i>his</i> side you can bet your bottom
dollar it&rsquo;s a plant! He&rsquo;s a treacherous devil,
and the only way to treat him is to fall on
him the moment he appears, tie him up, and
lodge him as quickly and as securely as
possible in the nearest jail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Chief slowly, &ldquo;there may
be something in what you say. But in all
my career I&rsquo;ve never yet refused to meet an
enemy who wrote and asked, fair and square,
for an interview. I shall see Grundt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; urged Desmond, &ldquo;look at the
list of his victims since he started his campaign
of vengeance against the Service&mdash;Branxe,
Wetherby Soukes, Fawcett Wilbur,
T&ouml;rnedahl, Miss Bardale, Bewlay, Finucane!
The man&rsquo;s a wolf, a mad dog! He ought to
be shot at sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief&rsquo;s strong face had grown very
stern. &ldquo;I agree. But I want <i>my</i> sight of
him. Don&rsquo;t worry, Okewood. I&rsquo;ve got my
tally against our clubfooted friend. He&rsquo;ll
get no change out of me . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. &ldquo;Half-past six.
He&rsquo;ll be here any moment now! Away with
the pair of you into the back room. If you&rsquo;ll
remove the map of the tube railways hanging
on the partition wall you&rsquo;ll find a trap which,
provided you don&rsquo;t turn up the light, will&mdash;ahem!&mdash;facilitate
both seeing and hearing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, once more . . .&rdquo; said Desmond.</p>
<p>The Chief shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t even got a gun!&rdquo; muttered
the young man forlornly as he accompanied
his brother from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>A &ldquo;buzzer&rdquo; whizzed raspingly through
Mr. Melchizedech&rsquo;s office. Composedly the
Chief rose from his chair and, crossing the
outer room, opened the front door. An
enormous man in a black wide-awake hat
with a heavy caped ulster faced him. The
visitor leaned heavily upon a crutch-handled
stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Melchizedech?&rdquo; he wheezed, for the
stairs had temporarily robbed him of his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; replied the Chief.
&ldquo;Please come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood back to let the stranger pass,
then led the way into the inner office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take off your things?&rdquo; he said,
and, pointing to a chair, remained standing.</p>
<p>With slow, deliberate movements the
visitor slid the ulster from his shoulders and
cast it with his hat on a couch. Then he
turned and faced the other, and, for a full
minute, the two men measured each other
in silence. They were something of the
same type, both of big build, both masterly
and virile, with iron determination shown
in the proud jut of the nose, the massive
cast of the jaw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>There was, however, a marked difference
in their regard. The Englishman was suave,
self-possessed, restrained, and his manner,
though watchful and even suspicious, was
placid and polite. But in his every trait the
other, his visitor, was restless and provocative.
The baleful glare in his dark and
burning eyes was in itself a challenge, and
his movements had something of the menacing
deliberation of a wild beast. There was
an indescribable air of primeval savagery
about him with his bulging tufted brows, his
enormous deep chest, his long and powerful
arms, his short thick legs, as he confronted
the other across the desk.</p>
<p>Presently his eyes left the Chief&rsquo;s face as,
with insolent deliberation, he let his gaze
sweep slowly round the room. It took in
the desk with its dusty bundles of papers,
the safe in the wall behind, the office calendar,
the clock, the hat-stand, and the filing-cabinet,
before coming to rest again upon the
impassive mask confronting him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>With a comprehensive wave of his stick
he indicated their surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Na,&rdquo; he croaked, &ldquo;as between colleagues
was there really any necessity for this
elaborate setting?&rdquo; Shrewdly he watched
the other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My instructions from the gentleman to
whom you wrote,&rdquo; replied the Chief evenly,
&ldquo;are to hear what you wish to say. I was
to add that, in according you this interview,
my Chief in no way binds his liberty of
future action, notably with regard to the
punishment he proposes to inflict upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anger flashed swiftly into the hard, dark
eyes. &ldquo;Punishment?&rdquo; he exclaimed; then
dropped chuckling into a chair. &ldquo;Bold
words!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;So ist&rsquo;s aber recht!
As between man and man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impressively he laid one hairy palm downwards
upon the desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have had ample warning of my
power,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have decimated your
Service, Herr Kollege; its <i>moral</i> is profoundly
shaken; and, after the series of sanguinary
reverses you have sustained at my
hands, I can only suppose that a form of
puerile <i>amour-propre</i> prevents you from
recognizing the futility of continuing the
struggle. So I have come to you, frankly
and openly, as is our German way, to lay my
cards upon the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not by so much as the flutter of an eyelid
did the Chief interrupt the flow of this
harangue. He listened quietly, composedly,
his keen grey eyes fixed on his visitor&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My work here is almost done,&rdquo; the other
resumed. &ldquo;For many years I have lived my
life intensely, working early and late, contriving,
combining, braving danger and defeating
intrigues, for the greater glory of
my people. But the world is changing&mdash;was
ich sage! has changed, Herr Kollege, and
the hour has almost struck for old Clubfoot,
as they call me, to take his retirement. One
last mission remains to be fulfilled and then
old Clubfoot retires to his vineyard in
Suabia, and politics will know no more the
greatest man in our profession since
Fouch&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>He seemed to swell up as he uttered his
boast and his deep voice thrilled warmly to
the fire of his egotism. Then his mood
changed. With a crash he brought his fist
down upon the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Bliss mission must not go through,
Herr Kollege,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>For the first time a new light crept into the
steady grey eyes that watched him so closely
from across the table. The expression was
involuntary and vanished almost as soon as
it appeared. But, mere flicker though it was,
it did not escape Grundt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surprise you, I see,&rdquo; the cripple
remarked softly. &ldquo;Nothing is withheld from
me, lieber Herr. Shall I tell you about Mr.
Alexander Bliss, senior partner of Haversack
and Mayer, brokers to the British Government,
and his mission to . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instinctive gesture from the other interrupted
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Discretion above all things,&rdquo; Grundt
acquiesced. &ldquo;To the capital of a certain State
contiguous to Russia, shall we say? You
are doubtless aware that its new-found liberty
has brought this ambitious Staatchen to the
verge of financial disaster. A brand-new,
spick-and-span army, costly missions abroad,
banquets to f&ecirc;te the promise of to-morrow
(but never the achievement of to-day), injudicious
speculation in the exchanges of its
neighbours have, as you undoubtedly know,
played such havoc with the national resources
that bankruptcy is the inevitable corollary.
The British Government, with the altruism
that has always distinguished its foreign
policy (I would not suggest for a moment
that the heavy commitments of British
capital in this quarter influence its actions in
the least!), has come to the rescue of . . .
of this State. Your Mr. Bliss, after a number
of most secret interviews with the
Finance Minister, has concluded a satisfactory
arrangement for the secret pledging in
London of the State jewels, the glories of the
nation&rsquo;s past. I think I have summed up
the situation correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leant forward across the desk, tapping
the blotter with stub forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will recall Mr. Bliss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
cancel the arrangement he has made. A
group of German financiers is prepared to
take such action as will avert the disaster that
threatens . . . this State. You will
recall Bliss!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Very quietly the Chief shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the British Government declines assistance,&rdquo;
Grundt resumed, &ldquo;this Government
will be bound to fall back upon the offer
of the German group. The withdrawal of
the Bliss mission will enable the German
syndicate to arrange a loan on its own terms.
I observe that you are already familiar with
the existence of this German consortium.
You see I am perfectly candid with you. I
will push my frankness a step farther. This
Bliss affair will be my last case. The matter
satisfactorily adjusted, I retire, Herr Kollege,
and enable you to reorganize your shattered
and nerve-destroyed Service!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reflectively the Chief stabbed at his blotter
with his reading-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on us, Herr Doktor,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;The two Okewoods are in
excellent health!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>A warm flush crimsoned the pallid cheeks
of the cripple. Hot anger suddenly gleamed
in his dark and restless eyes. But he controlled
himself. He ran one hand over the
close iron-grey stubble that thatched the bony
head and his fleshy lips bared his yellow
teeth in a forced smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever, clever young men, Herr Kollege!&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;I congratulate you
upon your Okewoods. May they live long to
enjoy the fruits of their cleverness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his mouth the wish became an imprecation,
with such glowing vehemence did he
utter it. He spoke with a snarl that for a
moment lent his features a positively tigerish
expression.</p>
<p>But the Chief had stood up. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
he demanded, and came round the desk.</p>
<p>Clubfoot, his hairy hands crossed above
the crutch of his stick, leaned back in his
chair and looked up at his interrogator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And now you know
what you&rsquo;ve got to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief plucked open the door. &ldquo;Get
out of here and go to hell!&rdquo; he said without
raising his voice, with the same dogged composure
he had maintained throughout the
interview.</p>
<p>Like some great animal heaving itself
erect, Grundt struggled cumbrously to his
feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;You . . . you refuse?&rdquo; he blustered.</p>
<p>The Chief ignored the question. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re not out of here in one minute,&rdquo; he retorted
with deadly calm, &ldquo;cripple though you
are, I . . . shall . . . kick . . . you
. . . downstairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning heavily on his stick, The Man
with the Clubfoot hobbled slowly to the door.
On the threshold he stopped and, in a gesture
of sudden ferocity, thrust his face into the
other&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have passed sentence of death on
Bliss,&rdquo; he said in a voice that fury rendered
hoarse and almost inarticulate, &ldquo;and sentence
of death on yourself as well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he passed out and they heard his
heavy footstep pounding down the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CHAMOIS LEATHER PACKET</span></h2>
<p>Three times in the course of the ensuing
week the Chief&rsquo;s life was attempted.
There is reason to believe, Desmond
Okewood says, that, previously to this,
other attempts had been made; but he has
certain knowledge only of these three plots.
No word of the outrages passed the inmost
circle of the Service represented by the Chief
himself and Collins, his confidential clerk,
and Desmond learned of them only when,
visiting headquarters one day, he observed
that liftman, doormen, messengers, and
clerks had all been changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one tampered with the lock of the
gate of the lift which works automatically
after hours,&rdquo; the Chief explained reluctantly
when Desmond tackled him, &ldquo;and, but for
a certain instinctive caution that has served
me well before now, I should have taken a
drop of six floors. Somebody inside did it,
so I made a clean sweep of the office staff
with the exception of Collins!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>But it was not until months afterwards
that Desmond heard of the youth who,
caught lurking in the area of the Chief&rsquo;s London
house, was found to be carrying a hypodermic
needle filled with prussic acid, and of
the endeavour to derail the train by which the
Chief was travelling to a conference in the
north.</p>
<p>But when, one spring morning, the Chief
arrived by car at Desmond Okewood&rsquo;s Surrey
bungalow, Desmond saw at once by
his face that the strain was beginning to tell.
The steady grey eyes were as keen as ever
and the mouth had lost nothing of its firmness;
but there was a set air of restraint
about the big man which did not deceive Desmond.</p>
<p>They breakfasted together and, the meal
done, the Chief proposed a walk in the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk better in the open air,&rdquo; he
remarked as he filled his pipe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>It was an old garden whose high red
walls, now clothed with the blossom of peach
and apple, were a guarantee against eavesdroppers.
For a spell they strolled in silence
along the paths bordering the beds bright
with spring flowers, the busy clamour of
thrush and blackbird the only sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days will see us through now,&rdquo; the
Chief remarked suddenly. &ldquo;Bliss has
reached Berlin with the jewels, Okewood.
He has had the most express injunctions to
hand them over there to a trustworthy messenger
of his choosing, for he himself, unless
I am greatly mistaken, is by this time a
marked man. The messenger will immediately
convey the jewels to Brussels where
you will take charge of them. A plane will
be waiting for you at the Brussels aerodrome,
you will fly straight back to Croydon where
a car will be in readiness day or night to take
you to the Bank of England. There you will
hand the jewels over to the Governor against
his receipt. Is that clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;To prevent leakage I forbade Bliss
throughout his trip to communicate with me
at all. I, however, have been able to send
him instructions from time to time. His
messenger was due to leave Berlin last night,
and will report to you to-morrow evening at
Box A at the Flora Theatre&mdash;it&rsquo;s a music-hall&mdash;in
Brussels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond nodded. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bliss had no means of telling me. But
I have arranged a recognition signal. The
messenger will ask you the question: &lsquo;Do
you know the Albany?&rsquo; to which you will
reply: &lsquo;From the Mansion to Vigo Street!&rsquo;
On that answer, and on that answer only, the
jewels will be handed over. Have you got
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond repeated question and answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds idiotic,&rdquo; said the Chief apologetically,
&ldquo;but I had to improvise something
on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when do I leave?&rdquo; Desmond asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the morning train from Victoria to-morrow.
You will be in Brussels by four
in the afternoon. A red Minerva car will
meet you at the station and will be at your
disposal for the whole of your stay. Just
say to the driver &lsquo;Albany&rsquo; and he will obey
your orders. He will take you to the theatre
and afterwards drive you out to the aerodrome
to the machine that we have ordered
for you. I honestly believe that nothing can
go wrong, for the details I have given to you
were sent sealed by air to Bliss in Berlin, and
I have word that Bliss has received them.
Our plan is, therefore, known only to myself,
Bliss, and you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the messenger . . .&rdquo; Desmond
put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so. But you can trust Bliss to
have picked a reliable person. He is, without
exception, the most suspicious-minded cove
I&rsquo;ve ever come across . . . Hallo,
what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A maid came hurrying up the garden path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman is wanted on the telephone,
please, sir,&rdquo; she said to Desmond.</p>
<p>They went into the house, where Desmond,
discreetly, left the Chief at the telephone in
the study. He returned to find the Chief
staring moodily out of the window in an
attitude of abstraction most unusual for him.
On the sound of Desmond&rsquo;s entrance he
turned round.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bliss was found dead in his hotel in
Berlin with his throat cut this morning,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;A remarkable man, your friend Clubfoot!&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>Desmond whistled. Then, with a shade
of anxiety in his voice, he added: &ldquo;I hope
you&rsquo;ll be cautious for a bit, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief laughed dryly. &ldquo;The warning
applies to you with stronger force, young
fellow,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Bliss&rsquo;s messenger left
Berlin for Brussels last night <i>with the
packet</i>, as the message puts it. If only he
isn&rsquo;t followed! . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;If only he isn&rsquo;t followed! . . .&rdquo; The
Chief&rsquo;s phrase accompanied Desmond across
the North Sea. The wheels of the Pullman
hammered it out as the boat train bore him
swiftly to the Channel shores, and it resounded
in the rhythmic thudding of the
waves against the sides of the Ostend packet.
He had a mental picture of the unknown
messenger being whirled across Germany,
even as he was speeding over land and sea,
towards that enigmatical point of contact,
Box A, at the Flora Theatre in Brussels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only he isn&rsquo;t followed! . . .&rdquo; The
phrase recurred to Desmond as the Brussels
train pulled out of Ostend&rsquo;s shabby station.
Had they really eluded the long grasp of
the man of might and mystery? If not, at
what stage would he intervene? Would he
interpose his massy bulk between the two
emissaries speeding towards one another to
meet? Or would he let contact be established
and, once made, break it? . . .</p>
<p>It was satisfactory to know, at any rate,
Desmond reflected, that, so far as his experienced
eye could detect, he had not been
shadowed since leaving London. That he
could set his mind similarly at rest about the
man he was to meet! In the square outside
the Brussels terminus the red Minerva car
was waiting, and its driver, a button-nosed
cockney with a surprising bilingual gift,
showed his recognition of the password by
the cheeriest of smiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>Desmond drove to the Flora at once,
though it was only four o&rsquo;clock. To his
great satisfaction, for he wished to make a
reconnaissance, he found that a matin&eacute;e was
in progress. He was not in the theatre for
more than twenty minutes, and he spent the
remainder of the afternoon on the field of
Waterloo. Visits to La Haye Sainte and
Hougomont and the attempt to snatch from
their rather mournful atmosphere something
of that mighty clash of arms effectively
took his thoughts off the work before him.</p>
<p>In reality, however, he was looking forward
with the keenest relish to the surprises
of the evening. He dined well but wisely at
the &ldquo;Filet de B&oelig;uf,&rdquo; and the half-pint of
champagne, which was his modest allowance,
seemed to quicken in him that lurking delight
in adventure which had first drawn him
towards the Secret Service.</p>
<p>The evening performance at the Flora was
billed to begin at nine o&rsquo;clock, but when
towards that hour, the ouvreuse showed Desmond
into Box A, the house was not half
full. Comfortable-looking bourgeoisie with
their wives and often their children, mugs of
beer on the ledge before them, formed the
bulk of the audience, and Desmond, whose
thoughts were with the auditorium rather
than the stage, found some amusement in observing
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>The performance had been proceeding for
about half an hour and a troupe of comic
acrobats were giving their turn when behind
him he heard the door of the box open. He
felt a thrill&mdash;the Unknown had arrived. He
heard the wheezy voice of the ouvreuse:
&ldquo;Voici, Madame! Merci, Madame!&rdquo; the
door swung to with a click and, as he turned,
Desmond found himself facing a girl.</p>
<p>She was in evening dress, which, after the
fashion of women at theatres on the Continent,
she was wearing with a large black
hat. Petite and dainty, from the nape of
her neck almost to her feet she was swathed
in a long Spanish shawl, white, on which
huge crimson flowers were embroidered,
with a deep silken fringe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, je regrette . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond stood up. The girl&rsquo;s arrival was
most untimely. At any moment now the
messenger might appear. Seemingly, she
had mistaken the box. Yet the grim old
ouvreuse had let her in. She was a pretty
girl, about twenty-five, he judged, and her
dark eyes, with their curling lashes, the
smooth curve of her cheek, were admirable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>The band was playing an interminable
quick-step, to which the tumblers performed
their tricks and contortions. The girl did
not advance into the box, but remained in
the half-light at the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I demand a thousand pardons, Monsieur,&rdquo;
she murmured in French from the
back of the box. &ldquo;I was to have met some
. . . friends who have not yet arrived. If
I might remain a little at the back of the box.
It is impossible to wait in the promenade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je vous en prie, Madame!&rdquo; said Desmond
politely, and advanced to the front of the
box to fetch a chair. But the next moment
he had stepped swiftly back from the red
velvet ramp and remained rooted where he
stood, staring, staring . . .</p>
<p>In the opposite box, with a party of men,
Clubfoot was seated. He occupied the place
of honour in the centre of the box, big, burly,
and determined. With an opera-glass he
was slowly sweeping the stalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; Desmond swore aloud.
He had forgotten all about the girl behind
him. Clubfoot had forestalled the messenger,
then, and had come to see the transfer
effected. It was ten o&rsquo;clock already. What
<i>had</i> happened to Bliss&rsquo;s man? . . .</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are an Englishman, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
The girl&rsquo;s voice, the voice of an educated
Englishwoman, broke in upon his meditation.
He swung round. &ldquo;I beg your pardon for
swearing just now,&rdquo; he answered in English.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I forgot about you!&rdquo; He cast
a swift glance at the box opposite.</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;You speak French so
well that I should never have taken you for
an Englishman,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, apart from your accent, I was convinced
from your appearance that you were
a Parisian,&rdquo; retorted Desmond gallantly.
He kept back in the shadow as much as possible.</p>
<p>Few women are proof against compliments
on their good taste. The girl flushed
with appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from London?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Desmond looked at her quickly. An incredible
suspicion had dawned upon him.
What if Bliss&rsquo;s messenger were a woman?
There was no reason why it should not be.
Nothing had been said about the messenger
being a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered tensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>The girl was at the mirror on the side of
the box arranging her hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do you know the Albany?</i>&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The question was uttered casually. Like
a flash the reply came back: &ldquo;<i>From the
Mansion to Vigo Street!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl whipped round, one hand beneath
her enveloping shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Quick!
Take them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond gripped her hand and drew her
back into the dim recesses of the box. He
could see that Clubfoot, facing them across
the auditorium, now had his glasses focussed
in their direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re watching us,&rdquo; the young man
whispered to the girl. &ldquo;Pass them to me
behind your back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavy packet, wrapped in soft chamois
leather, about the size of a cigar-box, was
thrust into his outstretched hand. It was
too large for any pocket of his suit, so Desmond
slipped it into the pocket of his grey
tweed overcoat, which he carried on his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was . . . <i>scared</i>!&rdquo; the girl murmured.
&ldquo;Bliss told me that an Englishman
would meet me, and I thought, when I saw
you, that I had got into the wrong box. I
didn&rsquo;t dare go out into the promenade again
on account of the man outside . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were followed here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. &ldquo;All the way from Berlin.
I thought I had given him the slip at the
station here, but, if I did, he evidently picked
up my trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like, this man who shadowed
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young man, slim and fair. He has a
long white scar on his face and . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-sst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond pressed her arm. The handle of
the box door was being slowly turned. They
drew back behind the door as it opened.
Then in the mirror hanging on the velvet
tapestry of the opposite wall Desmond saw
a face, bloodless and crafty, barred with a
livid cicatrice, the face of Heinrich, Clubfoot&rsquo;s
aide. He, on his side, must have seen
Desmond mirrored in the glass, for he
gasped audibly. The face disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to warn the others!&rdquo; Desmond
whispered. He glanced across the house.
&ldquo;And Clubfoot&rsquo;s left his box. If only this
turn would finish! They wouldn&rsquo;t dare to
attack us when the lights are up . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the tumblers were the star turn, the
top of the bill. With shrill cries, to the
lilt of that never-ending quick-step, they
bounced and whirled across the stage, working
up to their grand climax.</p>
<p>Desmond turned to the girl. &ldquo;Are you
game for a dash?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>He plucked the door wide. The corridor
was deserted. Behind them, as they stepped
quickly outside, the theatre now rang with
the applause that marked the fall of the
curtain. Desmond, the girl behind him,
darted softly down a staircase marked
&ldquo;Sortie d&rsquo;Incendie&rdquo; in red lights, that stood
almost opposite the box door. They descended
unmolested and Desmond congratulated
himself on his forethought in having
made that preliminary reconnaissance as he
pushed outwards the emergency door at the
foot of the flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>In the street without, by the side of the
theatre, the red Minerva waited. Desmond
thrust the girl inside, sprang in after her,
the self-starter whirred, the engine throbbed,
and they glided out into the broad and
brightly lighted avenues of Brussels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FLIGHT AND WHAT CAME OF IT</span></h2>
<p>From the barrier of the aerodrome,
where the Minerva pulled up, Desmond
could see the machine destined for their night
journey. What a puny thing it looked,
stranded there, forlorn and solitary, in the
centre of the vast open space swept by the
glare of the lights of the night landing-station
and surrounded by the long, low sheds
whose roofs were now silvered by the effulgence
of the moon!</p>
<p>On their way to the flying-field the girl
had told Desmond her history. Her name
was Mary Brewster, and for two years she
had been acting as confidential secretary to
the head of one of the British missions in
Berlin. Her General had recommended her
to Bliss as a trustworthy German-speaking
messenger, and though she was fully aware
of the danger of the mission, she had jumped
at the chance of a trip home at Government
expense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>She was a funny little girl, Desmond decided.
Her work in Berlin had given her
some insight into the workings of the Secret
Service, and the grave seriousness with
which she took her mission amused Desmond,
grown blas&eacute; in eight years&rsquo; experience
of its ways. Her very conscientiousness
made her profoundly suspicious&mdash;even of
Desmond at first; and she subjected him to
a prolonged cross-examination as to the <i>bona
fides</i> of the chauffeur. When the last-named,
on their arrival at the aerodrome,
went off in search of the pilot, the girl
wanted to know whether he was sure that the
aviator was to be trusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Desmond, laughing,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s not my responsibility. It&rsquo;s the
Chief&rsquo;s. Each of us has his job in this show.
The chauffeur&rsquo;s is to bring me alongside
the aeroplane and hand me over to the
pilot . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke they saw a hooded and muffled
figure detach itself from the knot of mechanics
gathered about the plane. It proved
to be the pilot, a swarthy young man, to
judge by as much as his helmet disclosed of
his features, short and stocky, in leather flying-kit.
He came up with the chauffeur to
the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my passenger, I think,&rdquo; he said
to Desmond. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all ready for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shot an enquiring glance at the girl.
Desmond remarked that she was to accompany
them on their journey. The pilot
seemed put out. The machine was a two-seater,
he protested; and he had been warned
to expect only the one passenger. Besides,
the girl couldn&rsquo;t travel in evening dress;
she would perish of cold.</p>
<p>Desmond swept aside these objections.
The girl, he announced with a humorous
side-glance at her, would sit on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the cold,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that extra
coat on your arm, which is doubtless intended
for me, will do very well for her. I&rsquo;ve
got my overcoat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he tapped his ulster bulging with the
packet of precious stones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>The pilot made no further comment, but
led the way to the machine. Rather sullenly
he helped the girl into the belted leather
jerkin he had brought with him, while Desmond
swung himself up the short ladder into
the passenger&rsquo;s seat, protected by a curving
shield of talc, behind the pilot.</p>
<p>The girl, helped from above and below,
clambered after, her hat in her hand. Almost
before they knew that the pilot was at
the joy-stick, the propellers began to roar,
the driver raised his hand, and all the world
except the lucent moon and the glittering
stars in the wide sky above them seemed to
slide away&mdash;the flares, the sheds, the trees,
the twinkling lights of Brussels in the distance.</p>
<p>Desmond gave a little sigh. &ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; he
murmured, and patted that comforting bulge
in his overcoat.</p>
<p>They had, indeed, he told himself, made
a clean escape, shaken old Clubfoot right
off their track. Since leaving the theatre
they had seen nothing of him or of any of
his men. If this were the last episode in the
master spy&rsquo;s career, it had ended, the young
man reflected, in his signal discomfiture.
Desmond felt his heart swell within him as
the icy night air smote his cheek and, hundreds
of feet below, the dim chessboard of
the Low Countries swayed and heeled over
beneath the moon.</p>

<p>Perched demurely on his knee, the girl
remained very still. Speech was impossible;
the deafening roar of the propellers saw to
that&mdash;but Desmond&rsquo;s quick intuitiveness told
him she was uneasy. Perhaps she was nervous,
he told himself; night-flying is always
something of an ordeal.</p>
<p>The channel was yet a silvery streak
below them when the pilot, crouched over
the wheel in front, turned and made a vague
gesture with his gauntleted hand. With
his huge goggles and furry helmet he looked
like some gesticulating goblin. He seemed
to be pointing downwards. At the same
moment the rush of air increased, a long
black ridge, far below at first, seemed to
rise and rise at them while, with a suddenness
that was pain, the roar of the propellers
abruptly ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engine missing!&rdquo;&mdash;the pilot&rsquo;s voice came
to them in a muffled roar&mdash;&ldquo;hang on!
Forced landing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>Out of the blackness, sweeping up at them
with hideous velocity, a light winked and
blinked. Coughing and spluttering, the
engine picked up again. Suddenly they were
bumping wildly over the fleeting ground past
a handful of stunted trees and bushes and, in
hard, black silhouette against the moon,
the dark shapes of some scattered houses.</p>
<p>The engine was shut off again and they
careered to a standstill, the machine trembling
to the gentle jar of the earth. The pilot
heaved himself up in his cockpit and pushed
the goggles back from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said, and began some technical
explanation to which Desmond Okewood
paid no attention. His thoughts were busy
with the next step. He did not relish the
idea of wandering about the country-side at
dead of night with some hundreds of thousands
of pounds&rsquo; worth of jewels in his overcoat
pocket. He looked at his watch. Its
hands marked ten minutes to one on the luminous
dial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea where we are?&rdquo; Desmond
asked. &ldquo;I am positive,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;that I saw a light as we were planing down,
but there&rsquo;s no sign of it now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>The pilot, who had jumped down and was
fussing with the landing-wheels, turned
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distance is very deceptive at night,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;That light is probably five or six
miles away. It&rsquo;s devilish fortunate,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;I know exactly where we are.
This is the War Office rifle ground at Stoke
Bay, about six miles out of Lympne. I was
at Dover during the war and know the whole
of this country like my pocket. So, when
the engine started petering out over the
Channel just now, I steered straight for this
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is it going to take you to put
things right?&rdquo; asked Desmond.</p>
<p>The pilot shook his head sadly at the plane.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say. At any rate, I&rsquo;ll never get up
here again in the dark. We&rsquo;d break our
necks most likely. You&rsquo;ll have to go on to
London in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond swore under his breath. It
seemed to him that the airman was taking
things very lightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; he remarked with
some heat. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m on duty, and it is
essential that I should get on to town without
delay. And in any case Miss Brewster can&rsquo;t
spend the night in the open, you know.
What are we going to do about it? Isn&rsquo;t
there anybody we can knock up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just occurred to me,&rdquo; answered the
pilot, wiping his hands on a wisp of cotton
waste, &ldquo;that I know a fellow who lives close
at hand. Magnus is his name, a very sound
chap. He has a bungalow a piece down the
beach road. We&rsquo;ll knock him up. I&rsquo;ve no
doubt when we&rsquo;ve explained things to him
he&rsquo;ll be pleased to give us a shake-down for
the night. He&rsquo;s on the telephone, too. Just
let me turn off the juice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clambered back into the cockpit and
busied himself with the engine. Desmond
and Miss Brewster alighted. Suddenly the
former felt his sleeve plucked. He turned
round to find Mary Brewster&rsquo;s big eyes staring
at him. With an upward glance at the
machine, she drew her companion unobtrusively
aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust him!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
. . . he&rsquo;s got a dishonest face! How do
you know that this landing isn&rsquo;t a plant? He
cut off the engine on purpose; I&rsquo;m sure he
did. He meant to land here all along. Look
at the ground! It&rsquo;s perfectly smooth. It&rsquo;s
an aerodrome . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aerodrome?&rdquo; broke in the pilot. He
had descended from the machine and was
standing behind them. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s an
aerodrome, an experimental ground. That&rsquo;s
why I steered for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond looked at him. Certainly the
fellow had a shifty eye. Now that he
regarded the pilot more closely, he noticed
that he seemed to be labouring under some
excitement. The man saw that the other had
remarked his distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nervy business, landing in the
dark!&rdquo; he was quick to explain.</p>
<p>Desmond felt that his suspicions were
ungenerous. He knew how airmen loathe
night-flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made a devilish good landing!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you must have thought us
very unappreciative. Now, what about your
friend Magnus?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>The girl said no more and they set off in
silence across the moonlit grass. In front of
them a black shape loomed immensely out of
the darkness. As they drew nearer, Desmond
saw, to his astonishment, that it was
an aeroplane, a huge machine with metal
wings on which the moonbeams glinted.</p>
<p>Desmond stopped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that plane
doing here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>The pilot shrugged his shoulders.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying out machines all the time,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting too much to the
left,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We want to bear more to
the right or we&rsquo;ll miss the gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Desmond was walking in the direction
of the machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; the pilot called out. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
like strangers monkeying about with . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond heard no more. He had reached
the machine. Mary Brewster was just behind
him. It was a tremendous machine and
its immense spread of wing quite dwarfed
them. A blast of warm air smote them on
the cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried Desmond, &ldquo;the engine&rsquo;s
warm. This machine has been out this very
night . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>He turned swiftly round to the girl. As
his eyes fell on her face, it blanched with
terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind you! . . .&rdquo; she gasped; but,
before he had time to defend himself, a cloth
fell across his face from the back and was
pulled taut, an iron grip clutched his throat
and he was borne to the ground. A guttural
voice said close to his ear: &ldquo;A sound and I
blow out your brains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the darkness rang a woman&rsquo;s
scream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN WHICH MISS MARY BREWSTER SPEAKS HER MIND</span></h2>
<p>Blind and helpless, gagged and bound,
his eyes bandaged, Desmond felt himself
lifted up and carried swiftly along.
Presently he heard the sound of the sea and
his bearers&rsquo; feet grinding on shingle. Then
through his bandage he was conscious of a
brilliant light. He was flung violently down
and the cloth removed from his face.</p>
<p>Silhouetted against the garish light of an
acetylene hurricane lamp in the cheaply
furnished living-room of a seaside bungalow,
Clubfoot stood before him. A hideous tweed
cap pulled down until it rested on the tips of
his large projecting ears lent him a horribly
grotesque appearance. He looked like a
great ape dressed in man&rsquo;s clothes. Mary
Brewster, trussed up even as Desmond was,
reclined in a chair. She had lost her hat and
her soft brown hair was disordered by the
wind. Her small face, pale and piquant, was
enigmatic in its absolute serenity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has not got the jewels, either, Herr
Doktor!&rdquo; said a voice.</p>
<p>Desmond could not turn to see the speaker.
He glanced down at the pocket of his overcoat
where the packet had been. The parcel
had vanished. It had certainly been there
when they had set out to walk to the bungalow.
Had that rascally pilot stolen it? It
didn&rsquo;t matter much now what had become
of it.</p>
<p>Clubfoot snarled out an order in German.
Rough hands brutally searched the Englishman&rsquo;s
clothes. Clubfoot looked on impassively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; reported the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be there!&rdquo; thundered Grundt,
&ldquo;unless one of you has stolen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Herr Doktor was himself present
when we seized the Englishman,&rdquo; the voice
protested. &ldquo;The Herr Doktor knows that
nothing was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ungag them!&rdquo; ordered Clubfoot. &ldquo;And
clear out! Warn the pilot to have the
machine ready for instant departure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>The order was obeyed, a door was softly
closed, and Desmond nerved himself to face
what he divined was to be the crucial ordeal
of his career. Never had he been in so tight
a place. It wanted hours to daylight, and
he was bound and helpless in a lonely district
in the hands of a ruthless and remorseless
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A false trail, eh?&rdquo; said Grundt slowly,
his nostrils twitching ominously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
play tricks with me, would you, you dog?
Do you know what I&rsquo;m going to do with you,
Okewood? I&rsquo;m going to kill you, yes, and
the girl as well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond felt his throat grow dry. &ldquo;Not
the girl,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not
even of the Service, Grundt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be a lesson to her to mind the
company she keeps!&rdquo; said Grundt grimly,
and produced an automatic from his pocket.
He bent to examine the magazine. Slowly
he raised the pistol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>Then the girl spoke. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t do anything
hasty!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Kill us and your
career is at an end. You speak of retiring
voluntarily. One shot and your retirement
will be compulsory. And Stauber takes your
place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubfoot recoiled. &ldquo;Stauber!&rdquo; he muttered,
frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a mess of things in England,
Grundt,&rdquo; the girl continued serenely.
&ldquo;Your employers, the big industrialists,
granted you this last chance. It rests with
you whether you give your employers your
own version of this affair, or whether they
take it from the English newspapers. Do
you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubfoot stared at her like a man hypnotized.</p>
<p>In the same business-like manner Mary
Brewster proceeded: &ldquo;Kill us and there&rsquo;ll
be such a rumpus that the echoes of it are
bound to reach Germany. You can&rsquo;t suppress
murder in England, Grundt. You&rsquo;ve
missed your chance of getting the jewels,
and what you&rsquo;ve got to do now is to put up
the best explanation you can. I know that
you have the reputation of being the man
that commands success. If you touch us,
that reputation is gone forever, for, you can
take it from me, the whole story, the true
story, will then come out and you&rsquo;ll be saddled
with the greatest failure of your career.
And your rival, Stauber, gets your job . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;That Schafskopf!&rdquo; muttered Grundt.
He seemed half dazed by the vigour of the
girl&rsquo;s onslaught. Then, &ldquo;What have you
done with the jewels?&rdquo; he roared suddenly,
recovering himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re out of your reach!&rdquo; said Mary
Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; snarled Clubfoot.
&ldquo;And you shall tell me where they are. Herr
Gott! You&rsquo;re not the first woman whose
tongue I&rsquo;ve loosened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it seemed to Desmond that, for all his
bluster, much of Clubfoot&rsquo;s wonted assurance
had disappeared.</p>
<p>The girl never flinched. &ldquo;Make the best
of a bad job, Grundt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Leave
things as they are and return to Germany
and you will hear no word from us to dispute
or disprove any story you like to tell
those who sent you. I repeat: You can kill
us, you can torture us, but you&rsquo;ll never recover
the jewels. Make up your mind to that
and go&mdash;while you can!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>The hairy hand that clutched the pistol
faltered and slowly dropped to the cripple&rsquo;s
side. Of a sudden he seemed to have grown
older. For a full minute he stood and
glowered at Desmond&mdash;the girl he ignored.
As the two men faced each other, it seemed
to the Englishman as though the scroll of
the years were unrolled and that, like him,
Grundt was telling over in his mind the many
bouts which these two had fought out between
them. Then slowly, listlessly, the
great hand went up and he thrust the Browning
into his breast pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told your Chief, Okewood,&rdquo; he said in
his deep, stern voice, &ldquo;that this would be
my last case. Though he has taken this trick,
I think I may let my decision stand. But
tell him this from me&mdash;that, though he has
gained this trick, he has not won the game.
The cards have been against me throughout.
I have played a losing hand, dealt me by the
blinded, besotted fools&rdquo;&mdash;his voice hissed
with anger&mdash;&ldquo;who, in overthrowing my
master, destroyed our country. But do not
forget that in politics nothing is stable, that
the enemies of to-day may be the friends of
to-morrow, and vice versa, Okewood&mdash;vice
versa!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>He broke off, and for an instant the dark,
expressive eyes rested on the young man&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not fall into the error of believing
that I am grown sentimental in my old age,
my young friend,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;I have
always been a Realpolitiker, and in this
instance I have bowed my head to the unanswerable
logic of your companion just
as in different circumstances, should my
interest, or the interest of those I serve, have
required it, I should have had no hesitation
in putting the pair of you to death. Your
luck is in to-night, Herr Major. You can
tell your Chief that you owe your life to a
woman&rsquo;s tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that he turned and left them, and
limped, a lonely defiant figure, to the door,
where the night received him and swallowed
him up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; cried Desmond when the door
had closed behind him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a marvel!
In all the years I&rsquo;ve known him such a thing
has never happened before. You beat him
fair and square! It was like a miracle the
way you laid him low! How on earth did
you come to think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a mass of vanity like the rest
of you,&rdquo; little Miss Brewster ejaculated
scornfully. &ldquo;A little knowledge, a little
intuition, a little bluff&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled rather
wanly. &ldquo;You men take each other too
seriously, anyway . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has become of the chamois
leather packet with the jewels?&rdquo; demanded
Desmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in a rabbit-hole by that German
aeroplane,&rdquo; said Miss Brewster. &ldquo;When you
would not heed my warning about that
odious-looking pilot, I took the packet out of
your overcoat pocket&mdash;I thought the jewels
would be safer with me than with you. And
as that man attacked you from behind, I let
the packet slide into a rabbit-hole at my feet
and they saw nothing in the dark. It seemed
to me it was time I took charge. They&rsquo;ll
never find that packet in the dark. But I
know the spot, and when it&rsquo;s light and we&rsquo;re
free, we&rsquo;ll . . .&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>Her head drooped suddenly forward. She
had fainted. Out of the night resounded,
loud and challenging, the roar of propellers . . .</p>
<p class="tb">At noon next day the Chief received
Desmond Okewood and Mary Brewster.
They found Francis Okewood in the office
with a grey-haired man of distinguished appearance
who was in the last stage of restless
anxiety. It was to him that the Chief, having
received it from the hands of Mary
Brewster, presented the chamois leather
packet sodden with damp and stained with
Kentish marl. With trembling hands he examined
the seal, and, having found it intact,
muttered a broken phrase of thanks and
fairly bolted from the room, carrying the
packet under his arm. The Chief shook his
head and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cabinet Ministers have great responsibilities,&rdquo;
he remarked, &ldquo;only they are too
fond of shoving them off on other people&rsquo;s
shoulders. And now, Miss Brewster, to hear
your story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>But Mary Brewster, who had faced The
Man with the Clubfoot unabashed, was
tongue-tied in the Chief&rsquo;s rather forbidding
presence. It was Desmond who ultimately
narrated their adventures of the night ending
with their release at dawn by an astonished
fisherman who, on his way to inspect his lobster
pots, had answered Desmond&rsquo;s cries for
help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They drugged and kidnapped the pilot
I had engaged for you,&rdquo; the Chief said after
Miss Brewster had taken her leave, &ldquo;and
slipped their man in his place. I have here a
telegram from Brussels about it. There&rsquo;s
been a leakage somewhere which,&rdquo; he added
grimly &ldquo;is being investigated. In the mean
time, thanks to you, Okewood, and to this
young lady, with whom I intend to hold
some converse regarding her future career,
we&rsquo;re rid, it would seem&mdash;for the present at
any rate&mdash;of Clubfoot and his gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner grew reflective. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;when and where we shall see him
again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>A silence fell on the three men. Each felt
that a fourth was present, invisible save in
the mind&rsquo;s eye&mdash;a vast figure of a man who,
with misshapen foot drawn up beside him,
leaned on his crutch-stick and glared at them
defiance from savage, cruel eyes . . .</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
